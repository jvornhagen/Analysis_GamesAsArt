In the way that i had to think about the puzzles, drawing connections between elements of different scales and orientation, i felt it described very well what it means to be human, and to learn with the world. It also made me question the role of my environment in my own development: the way my environment is affects the way i learn and the kind of inferences i draw from different situations.
To me, this is what art is about, it explains without explaining, asks questions without asking them."

The experience is personal, i am not sure that the creator intended it to mean a specific thing for me.	Yes	I have a strong emotion connection with this game, i replay it when i want to experience this again. It’s shaking my view of the world.	Yes	Seeing how my personality and learning depends so much on how my world is built makes me more open to exploring other perspectives.	No	i always believed video games can create such experiences, the interactive part is an interesting medium to explore for “art”-like experiences.	No	i believe every experience is personal and individual, i am not sure what the developer intended here. And i am not sure that it matters.			it’s a great direction to study!	1080.8	70.21			16.42				17.54			443.98													49.14		49.83		4.84		124.86								7.93		212.28								60.7			23.07

There are too many instances to recall one in particular, but I do know that the instances that made me think ""wow this is art"" were the most emotional events of the game - the plot twists in the Stories mode, the difficult decisions one has to make, the moments where the gameplay took me off-guard."	This War of Mine.	It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.	1-2 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		5	2	5	3	5	2	5	3	3	1	2	4	5	1	3	4	5	5	5	4	1	4	4	3	4	2	4	5	3	2	1	4	4	1	2	5	3	1	1	4	3	3		20	5	80	96	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes		This War of Mine	Sid Meier's Civilization V	Assassin's Creed: Black Flag			Yes	Yes	Yes	I think the experience of the overall game is meant to put you in the shoes of civilians in a genre dominated by games where you play the soldiers - it's a shift of perspective, that is both innovative and thought-provoking, both for its real-life implications (making you experience the hidden side of wars) and for its implications about games conventions (war games are rarely about the victims).	No	I already knew prior to playing that the game was unusual in its approach to the war games and simulation genre, so my expectations were already adjusted accordingly.	Yes	It made me want to play more games in the same vein and comforted me in my anti-war views!	Yes	This game was the first I played that so evidently defied my prior experiences and knowledge of digital games conventions, and reshaped the way I thought of games as a means of expression. I didn't really know how political games could be beyond their narrative, and this games gave me a glimpse of games' expressive potentiel.

From the very start of the game (crash landing alone on an alien water planet), I truly felt emotions through my character. The game's illustrations, sounds, music, and narrative elements all evoked these emotions. At first I felt the loneliness, hopelessness, and panic: terrified of the horrors that I might encounter in the deep ocean if I ventured too far from my escape pod. I saw the edge of the shallow reef, at first too scared to dive deeper. I heard the chilling cries of large sea creatures echoing in the distance. But the game is about pushing your limits. Eventually I gained the equipment and confidence needed to progress to the next deeper, more dangerous area, but there was never a ""comfortable"" moment. Aside from the audio/visual elements, there is also a mystery about the planet that unfolds as you progress. The story is told through non-traditional narrative elements: your character receives clues and information about the mystery of the planet through scraps of recordings and artifacts, not through direct narration or dialogue. All these elements together kept me on the edge of my seat, adrenaline rushing, like I was truly there."	Subnautica	For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response. Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.	1-2 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		3	1	4	3	5	1	3	4	4	2	4	3	1	1	3	4	5	3	5	5	1	5	4	5	5	5	4	3	3	1	1	3	1	1	4	5	5	1	1	4	3	4		23	10	68	32	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No		The Witcher 3	Skyrim	Stardew Valley	Subnautica	Portal	No	No	Yes	It changed my perspective on what video games can be in terms of immersion and evoking emotional response. Even though I had played other games I would consider immersive, in those other games I still felt emotionally detached from my character and the game as a whole. In Subnautica because of the way the art/sounds/narrative are all presented, I felt like I was actually in the game. It was a very unique experience.	Yes	Yes, I think Subnautica is a great and creative game.	Yes	The game makes you face your fears!	Yes	Yes, it opened my eyes to the many different ways games can be immersive, not just through art. It can be done through game mechanics / sound / music / and presenting the narrative.	Yes	I hope so! The game was beautiful and well thought out. I think there are some ongoing optimization issues with the game since it was released from early access, but the developers have worked to fix them.				3628.49	42.81			12.35				7.62			2503.51													63.92		52.37		4.01		116.34								5.92		705.96								110.02			3.66

I developed a real emotional connection with him over the course of the game, and was moved to tears by his redemption and death. It made me think of my own life and how similar I am to the character, and how brutal life in the Old West really was.	Red Dead Redemption 2	It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t. I found the impact to be greater than many books I’ve read and films I’ve watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.	2-11 months ago	Yes	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		4	3	5	5	5	2	5	3	5	3	3	2	5	3	1	4	5	5	5	5	2	5	4	3	4	3	1	5	5	1	1	3	4	1	1	4	4	1	1	2	2	4		7	6	31	23	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No		Red Dead Redemption 2	Crusader Kings 2	Minecraft			No	No	Yes	It meant that in watching Arthur’s redemption arc play out and guiding him through it, I was seeing myself in him and trying to figure out how I might apply what the game taught me to my own life.	Yes	Before I played through the story, I thought it was just a violent shooter game, but I realized how beautiful, artistic, and complex it really is.	Yes	I developed a real bond with the main character over the course of the game, and I felt a bit of grief when he died. Since Arthur doesn’t believe that he’s a good person and only starts to after he gets TB and is faced with death, it made me wonder if I have the same way of thinking. The game showed me that everyone has inner complexity which will inevitably show itself.	Yes	I now see them as a potential platform for creating works of visual art as well as literature, and a valid entertainment medium which should be destigmatized.	Yes	It’s clear that a lot of talent went into this game, especially the story. The experiences you have with Arthur even from the first chapter draw you into his inner world, which makes his end all the more poignant.				1785.99	50.51			14.46				10.89			717.91													50.11		54.33		7.07		86.29								9.09		641.76								109.89			33.68

The player connects with the environment deeply, as well as with other players, without ever speaking or hearing a word. 	Journey	In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music. This game was an incredibly emotional journey that I felt very connected to despite never being told what to feel. 	2-10 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		2	4	5	5	5	1	4	4	5	4	1	2	3	3	1	5	4	4	5	5	1	5	5	5	5	4	2	5	3	1	1	4	3	1	3	4	5	1	1	2	5	4		15	20	63	34	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No		Stardew Valley	Legend of Zelda franchise	Dragon Quest Builders	The Witness	Journey	No	No	Yes		N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A					520.14	55.35			13.12				10.07			218.36													41.24		40.93		6.09		127.01								7.97

This game was very philosophical in nature, examining the relationship between good and evil. The game introduces a variety of characters that exemplify either the light side of the force (good) or the dark side (evil) as well as a mentor character whose alignment is somewhere in the middle. 

At one point the mentor character explains that by helping people and taking on their burdens, you are teaching them to rely on other people's generosity for their survival. And one you have left they may actually be worse off. In contrast she also chastises you for overtly evil acts like winton violence.

This part of the game really made me consider the best way we can use our resources to help elevate those in need. Simply giving someone food or shelter is a temporary measure. The true good would come about by empowering those in need and helping them gain the skills and opportunities to care for themselves."

Just after starting the game I was greeted by an UI which was well crafted to combine functionality with design around the theme of the game.
During the loading screen which was an artwork there was a short bit of narrated information like you would find in a museum about Chinese history. 
Then I was thrown onto an artistic map of china with many details and sights. The map instantly sparked my curiosity about so many sights I never new of as I wasn't very familiar with.

Yes	I think games have the ability to elicit emotional responses much like any painting or opera. But not all games have to fit this. The core of gaming is to remain first and foremost a game.

The world is built and realized so beautifully. Each area of the game is distinct and evokes some kind of feeling - anxiety, calm, happiness, nostalgia. Each area has beautiful, distinct music. Colour is also used to differentiate the areas. The mood is crafted carefully and very successfully. It really is easy to get lost just exploring the world and learning about it. The writing is probably even better, to be honest. The game never tells you outright what happened to the world or what's really going on. Instead it leaves little clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or characters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you start figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking about it or trying to find out more. It's like reading a good book, except you get to explore it all on your own at your own pace. The game left me with a sense of wonder and a lot of questions to think about. For instance, one of the main conflicts of the game is about sacrifice. Children are sacrificed to become void creatures in order to contain the Radiance, a deadly infection that would wipe out this whole world if left to spread. It's a similar problem to the trolley problem in philosophy.	Hollow Knight	The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.	2-11 months ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		5	4	5	4	5	1	4	3	5	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	5	5	5	5	3	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	4	2	4	5	1	3	5	5	1	1	3	4	3		2	15	22	60	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Metroidvanias	Hollow Knight	Persona 5	Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time	The Sims 4	Animal Crossing: New Horizons	No	No	Yes	"I think it's up to subjective interpretation. The creators of the game don't consider any one of the endings of the game a ""true ending"". You have to decide to either try and defeat the infection to end this cycle, try to contain the infection within yourself in order to buy more time for the kingdom or become one with the void you were cast into as a child. That's really the big moral thing about the game, and the purpose is to consider the possibilities for yourself. With the game being as immersive as it is, the choices really feel like they have some weight. The game is also pretty difficult. The easiest ending is to stagnate things, and the hardest is to fight to end the infection. I think what the game means for me is that sometimes, there is no easy and kind way out of a situation. Some tragedies are bound to have victims and it's all we can do to try and minimize suffering. It's kind of bleak, to be honest. It also means to me that enacting change is very difficult, and you always have to kind of consider whether it's worth it to attempt it."	Yes	I started off thinking it was just an aesthetically pleasing metroidvania. Now I view it as a beautiful, thought-provoking piece of art.	Yes	It definitely made me think about moralities in a different, more concrete way. I think it's more concrete to me now that everything has a certain cost, and you can't always change everything you want to.	Yes	I didn't think before that I could get as invested in a game's story as I did for this one. I really enjoy a good book and I didn't think I could get an experience that parallels books from a game mostly focused on platforming and defeating bosses.	Yes	The creators have themselves said that they wanted to make a world that the player could get lost exploring, so at least that part of the experience was intended. I also don't think that meanings and themes this big would be in the game just by accident, not really meant to be experienced in a powerful way.				2364.11	72.86			15.34				9.73			980.86													64.4		52.51		19.51		199.6								8.53		831.92								82.46			26.39

I also liked that it made me think about things in a new way, as all good art does. It gave me the same feeling as visiting a gallery exhibition - like I understand another perspective on the world through the things I have seen. I felt like I understood the experience of living in a warzone much better, but more than that, I felt like the emotion had been captured and the bleak hopelessness mixed with hope that civilians experience came across as I played. The game itself had challenges and moral choices to be made, but gameplay wasn't difficult - I think that also contributed. If I'd been caught up in trying to WIN, I might not have paid so much attention to the feelings the game was creating. 	This War of Mine	The fact that it gave me the same feeling as going to a gallery. A broadening of understanding, and a new perspective on events I have never seen (although art can be something I relate to as well, in this case it wasn't because I've never been in a warzone). 	1-2 years ago	Yes	Other	Throughout, but especially at the end.

It meant that the creators had put a lot of work and effort into creating atmosphere and story, and that work had paid off. 	Yes	Without the experience, it was just a kind of mildly interesting survival game with a unique take on the perspective you play from (i.e. playing as a civilian). With it, it makes the game a work of art and deeply emotive and atmospheric, and very powerful. It means the game and my shift in emotion and perspective has stayed with me for years afterwards. 	Yes	For the next day I was very moved. I had a new perspective and I was deeply saddened by everything in the game I had experienced, and the struggle of the characters I had witnessed. I was already aware that people in warzones suffered atrocities and deserved compassion, but this was an entirely new level of awareness of how tough it is to survive and how families and people are tested and sometimes destroyed in cruel ways. 	Yes	I previously believed games could be works of art, but this is the first game I've ever played that moved me and made me think that games can change people's perspectives and can be that powerful. This game is a powerful work of art, not just a playful and beautiful thing but a dark and moving one that I wasn't sure was possible. 	Yes	If you look at the art style and the story the game tells, you KNOW it was set up to have that huge emotional hit. There is no other reason they would have done that. They also include facts in the game, and links to charities, so it is obviously intended to inspire emotional change. Also, I've read interviews with the developers where they explain what they were going for - dark, atmospheric, emotional impact, new perspective and understanding ... in short, everything that I experienced. 				1215.23	32.45			15.58				11.23			387.61													49.58		45.54		9.13		158.05								8.11		355.84								125.91			16.2

The game involves the playe controlling a man sat in a pot, who has only a hammer to climb the mountain in front of him. The The game was incredibly frustrating, but that was obviously the intention. The narration  explicitly talks about the author's intent, how he expects the player to feel and his thoughts on game design and development.  The emotional response of severe frustration is inevitable and intentional, and encourages thought about what the purpose of a game is.	Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy	As mentioned before the fact there was so clearly an intended emotional response, and that was linked to the an attempt to force the player to think about the purpose of games, about themself as a person makes it art.

There's also some stuff in there about the value of games and whether they're garbage to experience and throw away or something, but I'm not sure exactly what the point was.

I recently played a short game by Studio Oliomingus (sp.?) that  - to me anyway - had a wonderful way of communicating a narrative and a feeling of loss and melancholy through a surreal setting walking around weird buildings devoid of people but populated by giant old-fashioned telephones. 
Why is this art? Because it is an ""artefact"" that communicates something, I suppose. All man-made objects communicate, in some sense, but in this case it was definitely intentional :). It doesn't have to be as explicitly ""artistic"" as this game was in order to be art. I mean, Super Meat Boy or Super Mario Bros or some racing game or FIFA can be seen as art as well, IMO."

I'm not sure I understand the question. I think the fact that I had a certain melancholic experience stems from certain narrative tropes combined with a certain aesthetic approach to storytelling that appeal to me and perhaps touched something inside me. What is melancholy? Some sort of nostalgic longing I suppose, perhaps without a concrete focus. The meaning was an emotion, to put it bluntly, and I'm not really sure that there is a deeper meaning that that to be pulled from that specific experience.	Yes	"Since my playing of that game brought about certain emotions, I'd say that the experience and the emotion creates a kind of feedback loop, maybe? Also very theoretical, I guess, and I'm not sure I have the right words to nail the intersection of aesthetics, narrative, and experience, but I do think that it oscillates back and forth between the ""artwork"" and the ""perceiver""/""experiencer"" of that work."	No	It was a nice experience insofar as instilling certain emotions in me, but at the same time it was most definitely (to me) an aesthetic experience in the sense that the production/instilling of certain emotions seemed to be the purpose. If it had been grounded in, say, true stories of experienced oppression, climate change, joy at the birth of a child or something else, it might have hit a deeper note in me, possibly changing my viewpoints about a topic or prompting me to action in some way. As it were, this particular experience didn't.	No	I already percieve games as art, and that didn't change here. I'd say that I rarely encounter games with such a specific focus on instilling certain emotions, but it isn't a new experience for me. 	Yes	"Some kind of experience was intended, and I think many aspects of the game (as I recall it) plays into the melacholy/sadness/nostalgic longing that I remember. The retro-look of the huge telephones, the narrative you experience through them, the empty/vacant buildings that make up the world, paper planes flying about without purpose, perhaps even the red color of the phones. A general assumption is made here, namely that I and the developers share something, a common viewpoint or a lived experience or something similar. My 12 y.o. son would probably answer many of the questions in a different way, my 8 y.o. daughter perhaps even more so.
There is no ""correct"" way to experience these things (and if I was a developer - I would hope that someone experienced _something_ but not necessarily a specific thing)"			Hey nice questionnaire.

Art begin where the users own interpretation of the work affects how they perceive it. For my example game, the main character is left alone on a stormy island. As they explore the island, the narrator reads diary entries that give cryptic clues as to what happened on the island. Decorations amidst the island also fill in further details. The player is left to interpret what it all means, and based on the users life experiences might find that the story means one thing or another. This game touches on melancholy topics such as loneliness, depression, loss, and suicide, and in doing so teleports the user into the bleak lives of the narrator and his characters. The game gives no direct answers to what truly happened in the narrative, and upon finishing the game I was left with a strong sense of desolation. While it may sound like My example is artistic because it was cryptic or emotional, this is only the means by which the art of the game affected me. There was an ever-present sense of purpose and intent behind this game, and through its competencies I came to my own conclusions.	Dear Esther	Art leaves the user to reflect and interpret on it. While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.	2-11 months ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		3	3	5	5	5	1	5	2	5	4	3	3	5	5	1	1	3	5	4	4	1	5	2	5	5	2	1	5	5	1	1	4	5	1	4	4	4	1	1	4	1	1		20	15	100	100	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Magic Arena	Bioshock	Civilization V	Skyrim	Portal	No	No	Yes	I think I would need to replay Dear Esther to truly understand what it meant. My general understanding was of a man speaking to a daughter-figure in his life about the dreary reality of living all alone on a remote island. The solitude drove him to a kind of insanity, a depression, that in the end drove him to suicide. The player, walking through the island and listening the the narrators voice the entire time, is walking the footsteps the narrator took on his last day before he eventually kills himself by jumping off the top of the island's radio beacon. The player however, as they jump off the beacon and just before they hit the ground, begins to fly into the sky. The music changes to a more uplifting feeling, and there seems to be a cathartic release. This to me is an expression of how suicide is romanticized in the mind of the person committing the act. A belief that killing yourself will make everything better. While I personally don't hold this perspective, this game transported me into the mind of someone who would think that way. It gave me  something new to feel, and put me directly in the mind of its character.	Yes	Indeed, as i think this effect is the entire purpose of the game. It made me respect the game as a work of art.	Yes	I still think about the message in this game from time to time. I might replay it someday to experience this sensation again, and I often recommend it to friends.	No	I have pretty much always held the opinion that games are art, and Dear Esther surely wasn't the first game to make me feel deeply. Other games that left a similar impression are Bioshock, the Last of Us, Portal, Shadow of the Colossus, L.A. Noire, and many more.	Yes	See my previous explanations: This game was build with an emotional purpose from the start.

No	Competitive games by their nature inspire aggressive reactions like rage quitting.

So while the Rainbow Six developers certainly intended the game to be hard, I doubt they set out to make people feel bad. The only game I know of that intentionally does that is Psychologic.				1294.88	60.06			20.25				12.11			391.12													62.56		66.42		9.04		152.3								5.01		146.14								361.89			7.98

I’m the good ending, which I played through, you watch as this beloved man faces towards the sun one finally time after spending much of the game reflecting on whether he had lived a good life. I swear I can’t properly explain it but the time I played with Arthur (30 + hours) got me attached to him and it made me genuinely sad to see him go. His ending death scene would be considered art by me 	Red Dead Redemption 2 	The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others.

The story is intriguing and dramatic (and spread over many chapters).	Mutazione	Whenever I remember this game I am flooded with memories and feelings I have attached to it.

Undertale does this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you not kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely heartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a game where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you can play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse: kill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that only a game could create: you've come to love all these characters, and now you want to see what happens when you personally kill them all. And you have to really try to do it: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two incredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly cheats). There are moments where the game points out that you, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant of these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY punished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist route, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes with a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the monster you created in the genocide route. 	Undertale	To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.	1-2 years ago	Yes	Other	A second playthrough	N/A				N/A		3	1	3	1	5	5	2	3	3	1	3	4	4	1	4	2	4	1	3	3	2	3	2	4	4	2	2	4	1	2	1	4	4	1	3	4	1	2	4	4	1	2		23	50	100	100	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Undertale	Doom Eternal	Dark Souls	Etrian Odyssey III	Persona 4 Golden	No	No	Yes		N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A					1676.51	71.94			13.53				12.12			1348.1													36.9		40.19		4.61		142.62								6.5

The art style was consistent throughout the game and somewhat surreal/abstract which created a distinct atmosphere. These two elements combined made the game very immersive. The playthrough of the game was also fairly short (3-4 hours) which made it almost feel like a movie that you were a part of. The gameplay, art style, and story all combined to create a cohesive experience.	Journey	The meaning of the story was open to interpretation but felt significant regardless of how you interpreted it.

Most decisions are presented with a fair amount of time to consider the variables, and there is no mashing of multiple buttons to achieve complicated moves. The game is very story-driven with the player being limited often to only picking different choices that affect the major story, but only slightly, because the end result is invariably similar.	Life is Strange	I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story.

Yes	"Despite some weird lines that tried too hard to sound ""hip"" and trendy, the storyline is very current and speaks out about things that happen and aren't often discussed in teenagers' lives."	Yes	I wouldn't be able to elaborate too much, as the story didn't impact me directly or instantly. I might have grown as a person due to the topics discussed during the game, but those effects aren't apparent in everyday considerations.	Yes	It was another example that games can have more elements of a movie embedded into how they are built, and that it works. It made me wish for more story-driven games that offer options that impact the story directly, and that let us create a main character that we truly identify with.	Yes	Choices were a main aspect of how the game progresses, so I think it was exactly the main thing they wanted to make sure was present.				732.01	37.88			13.25				10.43			192.82													59.02		51.71		6.15		112.74								8.35		211.44								23.32			4.9

I experienced a game where you were at war in a burning city. The Sky was red in a beautiful way that made sense with the situation, also the music made you feel even more into the action, the behaviour of other carachters were brave and action never stopped. I think it was a beautiful piece of art. Just like other missions inside the same game. This game has always been called out to be overrated and maybe it is, but for me, the missions it had were beautifully made	Call of Duty: Black Ops	The scenario because of the colours it used, the design of the environment, the music it involved and the different events that made it more exciting. 	1-2 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		2	3	5	5	5	1	5	5	4	2	5	1	5	3	1	5	5	5	5	3	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	5	1	1	4	2	1	1	5	5	1	1	2	5	5		15	4	86	25	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	No		Call of Duty	GTA V	Guitar Hero	FIFA	Worms World Party	No	No	Yes	I have always had an special intetest in historic events, specially war and how was the behaviour of people around it.

What comes immediately to mind, though, is my experience with a game called Oxenfree. It was clearly art to me because it didn’t just make me feel something at the end of the story. I was deeply moved by the game, haunted even. It has stuck with me to the same degree that any other mediums of art have. 	Oxenfree	It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it. 	1-2 years ago	No	During the end		N/A				N/A		5	2	5	5	5	1	5	5	5	1	2	4	5	1	1	3	5	5	5	4	2	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	1	1	5	5	1	1	5	5	1	1	3	2	5	I think that the question asking whether it was sublime was apt. After experiencing Oxenfree, I felt like the romantics must have felt when in awe by their natural surroundings. 	14	20	100	99	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No		Rainbow Six Siege	Metal Gear Solid 5	Red Dead Redemption 2 			No	No	Yes	It was just another instance of art moving me on a fundamental level. It meant the same to me as reading a beautiful novel or looking at a haunting painting. For me, art is generally a way to have directed emotional experiences. It is about better understanding myself and how my emotional side sees the world. 	Yes	Yes. Though I may not remember the specifics of Oxenfree, nor how it ended, I vividly recall what I felt. Oxenfree, and artistic video games in general, are entirely indistinguishable in how they make me feel from what is universally accepted as art. 	Yes	It helped me better understand my emotions. While I still have a long journey before me, playing Oxenfree was another step in understanding myself. 	No	I have believed that video games are art for a long time. Oxenfree was just an example further proving this to me. 	Yes	While the exact things that I thought or felt may not have been intended by the developers, I am certain that they wanted to elicit an emotional response in their players. The story was structured in such a way to make you fall for the protagonists only to have them suffer in the end. Even though the game was not realistic, I felt as if I was there with them. 			I was not certain what you meant by “spurred me on” in one of the questions. I answered 3 only to have an answer there. 	1776.5	87.15			20.39				11.95			405.29													119.44		57.71		162.56		258.28								9.88		435.65								111.27			96.93

All the details feel real, in a sense. I hunt in real life and the hunting detail in this game is phenomenal: different weapons used for different game, tracking and stalking animals, even skimming the different animals was very accurate. I do appreciate accuracy. I also really enjoy the scenery in the game. A lot of it is based off of real life geography and it is all done beautifully and accurately. Besides all this, story line is where games hook me. I felt immersed in the world, and it was beautiful.

There was less emphasis on the game play than there was on the emotions it evoked and the art style	Florence	Mostly what I described above. Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project.

The game I'm thinking of is Journey. It was made by a small independent video game company at the time. The soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory, I think was up for a Grammy nomination. Every part of the game was crafted perfectly in order to elicit an emotional response, it is genuinely one of the best appeals to peace an environmentalism I've ever seen in a game. The lighting, the fluidity of movement, the bond that you feel between other players who you csnt even talk to, it all culminates in an experience that is nearly magical.	Journey	The quality of the worst that was put in as well as the over all experience of playing the game. The message also helped. It wasnt just a save the world type situation or a shoot and kill type game, even though technically it is a linear railroaded type game, it still gave you some agency of interpretation which I think is present in all art.

It had a consistent art style across all sections, but varied in color palette and mood. This game is like walking through someone's diary combined with looking at a photo album. You can appreaciate all aspects of this game from its visuals, to its story, to its soundtrack.	What Remains of Edith Finch	This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own.

Yes	It is easy to forget the amount of work that goes into certain arts like video games and movies. The fact that such an experience can be so well polished, consistent, and enjoyable is a testament to the people behind it.	Yes	"It made me think that video games definitely have the opportunity to appeal to anyone, not just ""gamers"". Even my Grandmother could appreciate a good story."	Yes	"I think the line can become blurred between what's a ""game"" and what is an ""experience"". Some games have no gameplay other than walking around, so called ""walking-simulators"" but they still require an amount of input."	Yes	The developers definitely intended to tell a story and highlight how games can be a medium for what would normally be considered more traditional story-telling, and then some. It proves that games have the potential to tell stories in ways that aren't possible in other mediums.			I think the range of emotions could be condensed.

While exploring the island, the man reads parts of letters sent to his wife, and slowly the story of his wife's death and of the island itself is revealed, though not wholly so. There is no 'game element' like a puzzle or a high score, and so it does seem questionable as to whether or not this is a game. Exploring the island is purely done on foot, and no running, only a slow walk. It never feels tedious however, as the game world is so intricately made and the dialogue is so engaging that the player is never bored.
The whole game can be played in a few hours. It left me somehow both melancholy and hopeful. The feelings generated from both the dialogue of the man and the images shown in the world were quite profound and stayed in my mind for the next few days. Right from the start, there was no point when I was not engrossed with the game, even though by all metrics it is slow. Though it is this slowness that allows each line of dialogue and part of the world to breathe; it is this that makes the game that much more impactful."	Dear Esther	The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.

In the scene you were able to ask the  other main character some personal questions about their life, with which you gained insight to both their and your playable character’s inner thoughts and feelings. The scene had a mellow song playing in the background and once you were done asking the questions, you could keep listening to the song over and over and have the characters simply watching the changing scenery as the train kept moving. 

Watching the scene made me feel at ease and sent me back to some early preteen years when things felt a lot easier. The audio and visuals of the scene made me feel nostalgic and a little bittersweet as well, but I couldn’t stop it from looping over and over for at least 10 minutes or so."

Possessed by an interdimensional being known as a traveller, Rayne is trying to cover up the murder the traveller forced him to commit. If the player doesn't have Rayne jailed, the game concludes with Rayne kidnapping you, planning to murder you so you cannot have him put in prison for the traveller's crime. In response, you can shapeshift into his closest friend, Bronwyn, to his shock. Resigned, he tells you he has no choice but to leave, in essence exiling himself so the traveller cannot return and he is not imprisoned. With a sad smile, he says ""I'll miss you the most"" and walks away, never to be seen again. I found this scene to be incredibly touching; Rayne is driven by his self-preservation and terror, yet is simultaneously unable to hurt Bronwyn even if refusing to do so puts him at risk. He cuts himself off from who he cares about most to protect them, and I think there's a beauty in that tragedy."	The Shapeshifting Detective	"""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off."

Yes	I loved The Shapeshifting Detective essentially since I first saw it, but this experience truly cemented it as one of my favorite games and an artistic inspiration.	Yes	It inspired an interest in FMV games which I'd now like to work on someday.	Yes	I'd never thought of FMV games as a genre with much potential before, but The Shapeshifting Detective showed me that FMV games are as capable as anything of being beautiful and impactful, and in a broader sense, that digital games are always capable of pushing boundaries and exceeding expectations.	Yes	From interactions with them, I believe it's fair to say the developers intended Rayne to be sympathetic even as an antagonist. As the adage goes, he did bad things, he wasn't a bad person.

Below were the various enemies I was supposed to be fighting - and all around me, I could see the rest of the levels map - the city in which I was infiltrating as part of the mission, but also the lush forests and ecosystems surrounding the area. More than anything my attention was captured by the beautiful picturesque sunset happening off in the distance, behind my character.	Sekiro; Shadows Die Twice	"There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger.

Yes, it holds an emphasis on fighting and combat, but it does a very good job of creating a intricately detailed story and overall world / setting.	No	Did the experience chance my perception of the game? Yes. Was it a life changing moment? No. I'm just happy to have experienced it!	No	I have been playing video games for the majority of my life, this isolated occurrence in sekiro did not reveal to me anything I did not already know. All I can say is that I have been thinking of video games as art for as long as I can remember playing them seriously :)	Yes	Despite the emphasis on combat and fighting and the story, etc, clearly the developers had a vision for what they wanted the in game world to look like and feel like. Some games may feel the need to have good graphics and other such elements as a way to draw in players. I believe the developers of Sekiro simply wanted to create a beautiful world for their story to exist in. Any person picking up the game will notice the effort and detail put into the level design, as it stands out in every regard, whether your looking for sunsets or simply appreciating a cool looking Boss fight!				2256.25	54.98			14.86				15.32			1243.66													51.95		68.33		3.37		223.32								11.85		282.8								278.46			7.35

The beauty of the city struck me, but the story I interacted with was far more impactful.

Only for her to die alone and afraid in the Divine Beast as Ganon destroyed everything, likely calling out for help that came far far too late to truly rescue her. The only salvation left being to free her spirit from the torturous monstrosity that killed and captured her soul. The grief and rage I felt at the indignity done upon her truly moved me.

Roughly speaking, it's about a narrator who shows the developed levels of someone else and thereby draws conclusions about the developer. 

Because of the open narrative style it also tempts more to empathize with the characters and think about how you would have behaved yourself. Thus the game becomes a very personal experience.

The short levels, which all leave a negative impression at first sight, can also mean something completely different on closer inspection. This also makes the game more and more detached from the author of the game and gives the player more and more control over what he makes of the game. "	The beginners guide.

Just as this happens, the credits start to roll and you actually play as a little spaceship shooting the words on screen. However, even now you remain hopeless because it's impossible to win. You lose again and again, having to repeat the same process over and over - pretty much mirroring the hardships the main characters had to go trough - and just as you start to become really frustrated and are about to give up, messages from other players all around the world start to appear. All these messages contain positive thoughts, urging you on to not give up and keep on going. As these messages become more and more, you start to realize that you are not alone in this, there are thousand of others around the globe, stuck in the same struggle that you are - until finally, you get help in form of other spaceships circling around yours, rendering the shooting section, which seemed impossible to overcome just a moment ago, incredibly easy. Thus you beat the final ""boss"", the credits, of the game and get to see the true ending, in which the main characters get reassembled and wake up to live another day."	Nier Automata	"The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point."	1-2 years ago	Yes	During the end		N/A				N/A		4	2	5	5	5	1	5	5	5	1	1	3	5	4	1	5	5	5	5	5	1	5	3	4	5	5	5	5	1	2	1	5	5	1	2	5	5	1	1	1	5	5	I felt a feeling of hope and empathy rising up in me - hope that there are actual people out there trying to help you trough difficult situations in life. People, who want nothing in return.	20	20	100	100	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes		Nier Automata	Final Fantasy 7 Remake	Zelda Majoras Mask	Bayonetta		No	No	Yes	"For me personally, it meant the world to me - i had just lost a close family member and was stuck in a really dark place, pretty much having given up on any hope of positive change. That is why i felt so connected to these characters who were stuck in a grim and hopeless world, in an endless loop of struggle and death. When in the end, these characters all survived, thanks to the actions of another player - in a strictly singleplayer game with no online functionality what so ever outside of this experience - i, too, felt that there was hope. Hope for humanity as a whole, hope for better days. Hope for myself. 
On a less personal level, i think the experience was also a thank you from the creator - Yoko Taro - to the players of his games. In pretty much every game he created, the main characters do not get to enjoy a happy ending. It always ended in suffering, for both the characters, the world they life in and the player. Also, all these games are losely connected (From the Drakengard series to Nier and Nier Automata), taking place in the same universe. So the player fighting the credits, the names of those who created the game, was the players fight for a happy ending. A happy ending for these characters you grow so attached to over the course of the game - the ending they deserved after years of sad endings in Yoko Taros video games. "	Yes	"Before the ending, i saw the game as an incredible experience already - an amazing story coupled with the trademark smooth and flashy Platinum Games gameplay.
But after having experienced this sequence, i realized that this was more than ""just"" that. That this was a once in a lifetime experience, one that would not have worked in any other kind of medium since it required the players input and consideration towards other players struggling just as he was."	Yes	See above. It changed my outlook on life and gave me hope when i had none.	Yes	"There are games developed purely for fun or human interaction - multiplayer, coop, rhythm, puzzle games etc.
There are games that try to create a cinematic experience, close to that of a movie. Games like Uncharted or The Last of Us.
And then there's games like Nier Automata that truly embrace their unique form of entertainment and the advantages a video game has over other media."	Yes	They outright tell you that you got help from another player and afterwards ask you to do the same - in the process deleting your game file. Also, the hopeful tone of the credits song swelling on as you get farther trough the sequence, getting louder and louder, repeating in different languages and finally becoming the humming of the chorus really helps create true feelings inside the player.				2529.14	30.2			12.38				36.82			1019.93													38.74		50.79		70.93		159.4								8.27		914.91								167.19			19.58

Afterwards you're shown a cutscene showing the Normandy, your ship being attacked by an unknown vessel of uniquely alien design resembling a sort of wasp hive built around a massive laser beam canon. The Normandy and it's crew are in grave peril with everyone scrambling to make repairs, bark out orders, or get to the escape pods. You are then moved to your character, Commander Shepard, a calm and steady leader whose face you cannot see behind his military grade space suit. While you make your way to the bridge to retrieve the pilot of the Normandy you see flames and pylons scarrtered throughout the ship leading up to the cock pit. As you enter the CIC (Combat Information Center, the place you used to navigate your ship through the galaxy) you are met with an immediate contrast to the blaringly loud, creaking, flaming ship into the silent vacuum of space. The entire ceiling has been ripped off, the artificial gravity isn't working in this section and you walk at almost a snails pace across to the cockpit. The only sounds you can hear are your own breathing through your helmet and the ship gets almost completely dark until you emerge at the other end finding the pilot. You convince him that the Normandy is gone and there's nothing he can do and safely get him to the last escape pod but you're not so lucky. One final blast from the alien ship sends you hurtling towards the planet below. Nobody is able to rescue you, your air tank has been breached and you're falling into the gravity well of the planet in a blaze. This is Mass Effect.	Mass Effect 2	The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment. The set design is phenomenal as all the spectacle that you see is literally and figuratively out of this world. You can feel the wonder and fear of every turn, the crew feel alive and believable. The sound design and choice of sounds are perfect. This game is exactly the combination of all forms of art into one experience.	2-10 years ago	No	During the beginning of the game		N/A				N/A		5	3	5	5	5	1	5	5	5	4	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	1	1	1	3	1	1	4	5	5	1	1	4	5	3		16	28	97	79	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No		Mass Effect 2	Fallout	The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	Halo 2	XCOM 2	No	No	Yes	My experience meant that I would be able to experience a story unlike anything I had ever seen before, meet people, explore places, and make a meaningful change in the universe.

Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes.

AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well.

Most video games I have played admittedly aren't necessarily intellectually challenging, nor do they seem to try to make any kind of real statement about our world or society. I think the two most impactful games I've played are RDR2 and Prey. AC games are a bit more lighthearted and don't really seem to make any kinds of statements. That being said, I still think they are worthwhile pieces of art. I don't believe that all art must necessarily be intellectually challenging, or even make a statement. I would describe the experience primarily as ""fun!""  But I did feel a sense of awe  and wonder exploring the world, a sense of sadness and even grief when emphasizing with the player character, and a sense of satisfaction whenever I completed an objective in a way that I wanted to. I'm not sure what I would say the experience *meant* to me, though. I can say that I appreciated it, and all of the work that goes into creating such games. "	No	I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what that question is asking. The experience I had playing the game and my ultimate views of the game are intertwined. I do not think I can separate them and speak on how one affected the order. How I view any game is just an extension of my experience having played it. 	No	I wouldn't say that playing the game really had any kind of fundamental impact on me. That is to say, I don't think that it really impacted or changed my worldview, or any aspect of my personality, or something like that. It did pique my interest to learn a little bit more about Ptolemaic Egypt though, a period of Egyptian history and culture which admittedly I didn't understand incredibly well before. (Not that I understand it incredibly well now haha) 	No	I already felt that video games can be art, since playing Skyrim a number of years ago as an adult. It was the first video game I ever played aside from The Sims when I was a kid. I thought I would hate video games because I hated playing Mario at friend's houses. But when my husband bought an Xbox to play Skyrim, I was captivated watching it. That began my love of video games! 	Yes	I think most, if not all, video games are created with the primary intent being entertainment. It certainly achieved that goal. I also do think the writers of the story intended it to have an emotional impact, and it did - I cried a few times playing it! 				2606.33	436.33			12.43				23.03			746.77													49.41		49.1		4.48		275.54								18.83		872.22								95.25			22.94

The way the exotic, yet familiar natural environment of the planet the player character lands on is contrasted with the regularity and familiarity of the fully automated production lines. The music blends the serenity of the alien world's natural beauty with the technology the player uses to advance in the game.	Satisfactory (early access)	In order to advance in the game, the player has to exploit the planet's resources and mark its surface.

You spend the majority of the game trying to fulfill this prerequisites you must complete before Satan will accept your challenge. At the very end of the game, when you go to finally challenge Satan, you find that he is in the middle of an intervention for alcoholism by the other residents of Hell. Satan refuses to admit that he has a problem, and challenges the player to a drinking game, which I initially refused to participate in out of not wanting Satan’s substance abuse issues to become worse (I have had people in my life who have had problems with alcohol.) Satan will then inform the player that if they refuse to compete, then they will remain dead forever and will not be revived for being virtuous. I realized immediately due to experiences with other games by this creator that this was not a bluff, but instead a legitimate warning. After losing, Satan will allow you to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan and felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing the other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled Satan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I had done the right and just thing. I always like to win, I’m a very competitive person, and I have a deep rooted fear of death and failure (my two biggest fears) - I had defeated my insecurities and accomplished what I set out to, but at the cost of knowing that I had become the kind of destructive presence for Hell that I absolutely despise from people in the real world. It made me think about my own values, and beliefs, and morals, and how they can be set up to conflict with one another. 	Afterparty	The game made me, without even realizing it, made me prioritize my own goals and desires at the expense of my own personal experiences and the kind of person I would want to be. I won, but the game made me ask myself if winning was worth it. It made me feel and introspect. That is what made the game art.

No	No change, I’ve had many experiences where games challenged my views and stirred emotions in me. 	Yes	The developers made sure to have Satan tell the players they couldn’t achieve their goals and keep their morals, they’d have to choose. Satan will also invite the player to challenge him again should they lose Satan’s challenge - thus failure is not an ending. You play until either you win or you stop trying to. 			I chose Afterparty due to it being my most recent experience. I’ve also had similar moments with many other games. 	2986.54	83.19			10.35				13.68			1663.23													45.57		52.95		26.29		288.04								9.75		571.47								153.01			69.01

I would also spend hours simply wandering the countryside to take in the beautiful scenery. When the story ended, I was heartbroken at the conclusion and it affected me deeply. I cried through the credits, and I felt like I had lost a close friend. Then, the epilogue began and I felt like it was too soon; I felt like I needed more time to mourn the ending of the game. As I played through the epilogue, I continued to feel sad for the loss of the main character, even as I was happy to see the evolution of the other characters.	Red Dead Redemption 2	I didn't care about the gameplay or mechanics; I was motivated entirely by the visual and emotional beauty, and the emotional experience was so powerful that I still feel strongly when I reflect on the experience.

Experientially, the game invites you to be the co-author of a story. Importantly to the experience, the pacing of the story is controlled by the game, but many of the elements are left with the player (colony creation, quest decisions), or left to the player to decide if they'd like to author them or leave them to the game to manage (pawn names, optional micromanagement like schedules - which have an impact on the relationships between pawns over time). Experiencing a story like this is firmly in ""art"" territory for me, but the hybrid reader-author relationship tickles a particular kind of creative aspect that resonates with me in particular."	Rimworld	Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art.

Yes	I have a slightly troubled relationship with Rimworld, because the primary designer & developer has a problematic view of gender and sexuality, which is reflected in the code/rules of the game. However, reflecting on my experience with the game itself, I feel that the stories Rimworld co-authors with its players take on significance according to the player, and are frequently LGBT positive.

I felt calm and happy when it happened, and it made me want to go outside and travel to beautiful places.  I wanted to visit the place I grew up, which is much more rural than where I live now.  I was a little sad and nostalgic.  I think it's remarkable that art can evoke such feelings.  It's one of the reasons I love the game.	Yes	Although I enjoyed playing the game before, this experience and other moments where I saw the art of it have made it a favorite of mine.  I've put over 80 hours into the game and I haven't actually finished it yet because I want to keep having beautiful moments and not end the game.  Sometimes when playing, I'll just ride my in-game horse around and look at scenery or gather mushrooms because it's so calming.	Yes	Playing the game makes me happy and gives me a nice and relaxing moment.  I sometimes play the game when I'm feeling sad or upset because it makes me feel better.  It's been a good coping tool in recent times (2020 sucks).	No	I'd always been a fan of beautiful games, and I've had many moments like this, although this was the most recent.  I think Okami is also a beautiful game, and I've watched others play them as well (my brother played Muramasa the Demon Blade and Viewteful Joe, both of which are visually stunning in different ways).  If we're talking about beautiful game environments in particular, I also had moments like that when playing World of Warcraft as a teen.  I love games.	Yes	Just in terms of the graphics themselves, the attention to detail is excellent.  The lighting conditions, water, foliage, and clouds all look amazing all of the time.  The world is vibrant and varied and clearly sculpted with a lot of care.  I would think the game devs would love to know that the work is appreciated.  But I know they must have wanted to show off the world because there are a few gameplay elements that make it necessary: 1) the main character has a camera and taking pictures of animals, plants, and monsters is a required part of the game to fill your encyclopedia and to complete some quests, and 2) the wide game world is speckled with little critters called koroks that hide around the map in strange places.  They are found on the tops of tall trees, in rock circles, in the water, all over ever inch of the world.  Finding them means you have to look at the environment and go everywhere, even places you might not usually think to go.  i think finding the koroks is rewarding in itself because I like to collect things in games and it's like a treasure hunt, but it's also an elegant way to force the player to look at the whole game world.				1685.64	51.7			20.57				40.79			286.71													47.03		45.78		3.37		205.08								100.6		477.78								319.11			87.12

I had to stop playing and just look around because the game was so beautiful.  The sky is what started it, because it looked like a real life sky. The entire game itself is beautiful, but the sky took my breath away. I forgot I was playing a game and just looked out at the beautiful scenery. It's amazing how far technology has come.	Uncharted	For me instead of the graphics of the game being a means to an end meaning they allowed me to play the game, I experienced the graphics as a means to their own end. I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way. For me, art is about feeling something and this video game did that using colors and lines instead of just dialogue and story. 	2-11 months ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		3	5	5	5	5	1	5	2	5	2	2	1	5	5	1	3	5	5	4	5	1	5	5	2	3	1	1	4	1	1	1	1	2	1	1	2	1	1	1	1	5	1	I felt privileged that I was alive when technology has advanced this much since my parents' favorite video game was pacman.	20	10	39	22	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No		Uncharted	The Last of Us	The Sims	BioShock	Ark	No	No	Yes	I think it meant that video games have evolved into a new era and that various institutions should take note instead of constantly belittling the entire video game industry.

You have spent the entire game nurturing this relationship with Delilah, as well as trying to handle Henry's own trauma. So much of their conversations reflected how I felt, handled things. I wanted there to be a happy ending, a way in which both characters step away contented. But in truth, the ending is almost hallow, a real gut punch. I remember sitting as the credits role, wishing I could go back or somehow change the events, but they needed to be as they were to be that impactful. 	Firewatch	Art as a concept is huge, I think there is a little bit of art in everything. Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, I think real art challenges you in some way or holds up a mirror to reflect in. Firewatch both challenged me emotionally, and caused some deep introspection about relationships.	1-2 years ago	Yes	During the end		N/A				N/A		3	3	4	5	5	2	4	3	4	3	4	2	5	3	1	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	1	4	5	1	1	4	4	1	4	3	3	3	1	3	3	3		15	6	85	95	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	Walking Sims	The Stanley Parable	Return of the Obra Dinn	World of Warcraft	Firewatch	Darkest Dungeon	Yes	Yes	Yes	It meant that I personally had some unanswered questions about how I approach relationships, how I tackle issues by often avoiding them rather than addressing them. As I said before about having a mirror held up, the game was an experience to vent/explore those feelings that I had otherwise repressed.	Yes	I've viewed the game highly, to the extent that I will sometimes revisit the game. Roughly once a year to get that experience again, knowing full well the ending won't change regardless of my choices.	No	I don't believe it did, it caused a fair amount of introspection. But I've not actively changed, perhaps following the game I was increasingly thoughtful of my partners feelings but I can't pinpoint this game as being the sole cause.	No	Firewatch wasn't the first of its kind, just one such example of a game done incredibly well. This experience was more about me, and less about the game.	Yes	The start of the game gives you a fair amount of control over Henry's backstory, allowing you to personally relate and become invested with his character. 				1234.34	73.72			12.68				12.58			476.24													45.65		50.37		3.1		118.95								11.36		382.35								43.76			3.58

I remember feeling completely invested and drawn in to every side quest and small task I was asked to do. This, to me, is a large feat to accomplish considering I have played many video games in the past and have never felt the way that I did about this particular game. I was bought in to the world and it’s lore through the wonderful experiences I had doing these side quests. Everything felt so rich and nuanced and detailed.	The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	I consider this experience artistic because like any film or book or painting, it told a story that was deeply meaningful. The narrative of the game and its writing wrestled with issues of morality, class, racism, sexism, and many other topics in ways that many other video games have been afraid to touch. The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralt’s reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of art’s tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before. I think this game did just that in my experience. 	2-10 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		5	3	5	3	5	5	5	4	5	3	3	4	5	1	5	5	5	5	5	5	2	5	2	5	5	5	4	5	4	4	1	5	4	1	4	5	4	1	1	5	2	5		20	10	100	100	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	Yes		The Witcher 3	What Remains of Edith Finch	Dragon Age: Inquisition	Everyone’s Gone to the Rapture	Final Fantasy 14	No	Yes	Yes	I think it reflected the value I place on good narrative and performance in video games.

Yes	The Witcher 3 is an example of exceptional storytelling, something that is, in my opinion, critical to any art form. 	Yes	My decision to become an actor was based in large part on the way this video game moved me. The writing and performances gave me a sense of wonder that I wanted to in turn give to other people. 	Yes	My expectations for what video games can do for us has certainly been elevated by this game. We have humbly stepped beyond the boundaries of Pac-Man into thrilling terrain suitable for the makings of art. 	Yes	From what I know of the development company, their intention with this game was specifically to reach beyond anything they had done in the past to give their audience experiences where the players had to make choices that will stick with them for the rest of their lives. 				1746.62	137.62			20.44				22.69			571.47													106.75		64.24		6.03		239.08								11.97		430.37								102.6			33.36

The game is aesthetically pleasing and has a distinct visual style. There were times when the landscape in the game struck me as particularly beautiful and I would spend a few moments just appreciating it, the same way I would a painting in a museum. I also loved the character and clothing designs in the game, and appreciated the time and thought that obviously went into creating them.	Breath of the Wild.	I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.	1-2 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		3	4	5	5	5	1	4	4	5	5	2	1	5	4	1	4	5	5	4	5	2	5	5	4	5	4	1	4	2	1	1	3	4	1	1	4	4	1	1	1	5	3		16	8	62	67	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	Specific preference for Open World games	Dragon Age: Inquisition	Breath of the Wild	Witcher 3	Overwatch	Animal Crossing	No	Yes	Yes	I'm not sure how to answer this question	Yes	I think it deepened my enjoyment of the game and made it more memorable for me	Yes	I would say that I came to view the game as a very positive or even comforting experience and sometimes go back to it just to wander around and enjoy the atmosphere even though I've already completed the main story	No	I don't think the experience had a significant impact on my views, I've always believed games could be a form of art	Yes	The creation and design of the game felt very intentional to me.

It was literally about stopping to smell the ancient and enlightening roses while reaching ever closer to some end. A mysterious and melancholic and euphoric end that we could never have guessed. 	Yes	I was overcome with emotion at the end. It was something I wish I could do again. It was profound. I’ve never forgotten the feeling I felt upon seeing that strangers name on the screen at the very end for the first time. 	Yes	I realized they can do so much more with so little. It’s a very effective take on minimalism. 	Yes	Absolutely. I believe every experience I had was intended this way. The mask of anonymity was positively implemented for maximum effect.

I remember being completely fascinated by the visual aesthetics: it was somewhat dark and gloomy, yet so magically beautiful. My thoughts at that moment went to Kants descriptions of sublime: it was threatening and dangerous, yet beautiful. i knew if i were playing i would be nervous and stressed to do well, but i found the graphics to be incredibly enchanting, even dreamy. The setting was nature, with a lot of contrast between light and dark, some sharp edges and cloud-like appearance of the lighter areas, with tiny specs of light floating around. I felt nervous excitement about the game play and calm serene feeling at the same time due to graphics. My focus was torn between wanting the character to perform well and the admiration of visual aesthetics. There were mostly two feelings, a discrepancy between both, I was afraid and mesmerized at the same time.
(When I later played the game myself, I had the same feeling, but not as intense due to more exposure.)"

I felt that the game very profoundly captured the experience of living in a small provincial town without prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express this, and then to transform this into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create an experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics helped me to physically identify with the main character, and encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And the experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have in my own home town. I think this physical identification helped create space for a psychological identification with a complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In conversations with ""my"" family I wanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between this and living as ""myself"" in this town, under these emotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game are all about building and maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining your identity - they do not affect your ""progress""  or achievements as such - this captures something fundamental about daily life I think - most of our choices are like this. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it an object of reflection. 


When playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it was creating a language for itself, and about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative overreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game where I could see a distinct language for games being created in a similar way. In this case a language of agency and constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own agency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions. 
The light platforming and exploration element is again important in this - it brings an element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively point and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a really effective tension between freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and expresses the themes and experience of the art.
There is a scene at a party which captures this well - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you can only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time - you have been away from these people for years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by your past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the knowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene written so convincingly that the effect of these forced choices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in the game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't think of another work of art which captures the experience of being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well. The scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and familiar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming conventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in a way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And most interestingly it leverages features of gaming which some have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is a small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works with the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an experience quite forcefully."	Night in the Woods	The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.  	1-2 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		4	5	5	3	5	4	5	5	5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	3	5	2	4	4	5	4	2	5	5	3	1	5	5	1	2	5	3	1	1	5	4	5	"I felt inspired to create.

Yes	I think this scene was the moment which made me see these themes throughout the rest of the game.  It also made me see how simple, non technical aspects of gaming can create profound opportunities for reflection and experience, and allowed the game to act as an exemplar for me in thinking about the kind of work I want to make.	Yes	I grew up in a similar town (albeit in Britain), so it captured and helped me process my feelings about that place. It also helped me to reflect on my behaviour when younger.	Yes	It made me take games seriously as a grassroots artistic medium, rather than a bland, gate-kept big money theme park. I saw that games could articulate the experiences of people like me, be made by people not so different from me, and deal with complex issues while still speaking to a huge audience. I saw that games were becoming for a lot of people what popular music was for a while.	Yes	I've subsequently read interviews and writing by the developers and they talk about things very close to this.			Thanks for the opportunity to think about something meaningful to me. I hope I understood the first big question about the experience correctly - I now wonder if I focused enough on a particular experience (in part because I saw the game as a whole as the art, not any particular moment or experience, and I think this is characteristic of art in general). I hope it's useful.	3362.99	13.23			11.52				6.09			2242.3													59.1		88.41		82.01		140.29								9.25		550.03								42.53			118.23

The experiences with the game's characters up to that point (in overall plot scenes, single-character support dialogues, and even small in-battle dialogue), overarching plot, and even visual/music cues made it feel like a very significant decisive moment. (In hindsight, it's a bit surprising that a statement like ""This decision will drastically alter the story."" wasn't immersion-breaking, but with the overall quiet except for a 'heartbeat' sound, it made it work. And I only just realized while writing this that at that point, the main character doesn't have a heartbeat.) The parts immediately leading up to it and reactions afterward also had excellent voice acting that were great at bringing out the right emotional effects for me. (Other, more 'meta' realizations like that I wouldn't have liked the scene nearly as much with a male main character didn't come until quite a bit later.) Also, I honestly didn't have a whole lot of doubt about what I would decide, but it still felt very heavy and significant. (I sided with Edelgard. Just so you know.)"	Fire Emblem: Three Houses	I can't entirely say, since I don't have a particularly concrete definition (it strikes me as one of those frustratingly vague things like gender, and not something that can clearly be defined in a sentence or two), but it evoked at least as much emotional impact in me as other media experiences (books, movies, etc.) that I know typically are considered art, so it seems to fit to me.	2-11 months ago	Yes	Other	During a pivotal cutscene near the end of the first half of the game	N/A				N/A		1	1	4	2	3	1	2	2	3	1	1	1	2	1	1	4	5	3	4	3	1	3	2	2	3	3	1	3	1	2	1	2	3	1	2	3	2	1	1	1	1	4		25	14	79	28	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes		Fire Emblem: Three Houses	Dragon Age: Origins	Fallout: New Vegas	Final Fantasy Tactics	Persona 4 Golden	No	No	Yes	Ultimately, I think it's asking both how you feel about the characters in question, and possibly more broadly about whether you will fulfill a given purpose/destiny or fight against it. I think that some real-world perspectives will inevitably also color someone's perception here (for instance, with Rhea being established as a religious leader, that would evoke your feelings about religion more generally and that would most likely play into your decision).	Yes	I was, in retrospect, impressed that a single binary choice could feel very significant and meaningful in context even when there were very few to no impactful choices throughout most of the game. It gave me a very favorable impression of the writing and I will strongly recommend the game to others.	No	It's certainly very memorable and is part of why I'd strongly recommend the game to others, but I don't know if that goes to the level of 'impact' you mean here.	No	I've been playing story-driven RPGs with significant choices for quite a while now, so I already knew all of this could be done, even if I didn't see it coming in this specific form.	Yes	There are entirely separate routes for the branching paths, so I'm sure they intended for it to be significant. I do sometimes wonder how much they expected people to lean toward each choice, however, and I'd be curious to compare that to the actual results (as well as correlations between that and various demographic facts about the people making those choices).				2216.38	10.43			10.25				123.37			1235.53													44.92		58.08		7.3		99.49								5.3		495.64								98.32			27.75

It was a rather depressing quest in an area that was very beautiful compared with other areas in the game. I was conscripted by an elderly mother to find her four lost children. As the mother stated, each of her children are very ambitious in their own separate way; which in turn gave leads as to where they might be. As you proceed through the quest you find that each child has met his/her end in a tragic accident either guided by misfortune or recklessness. After you've collected a memento from each child's personal belongings you return to the mother bearing only these small items. The mother, so deeply saddened by the loss of her children simply passes away sparing a few short words for thanks. The quest is called ""Spirited Away""."	The Elderscrolls Online	The fact that it was able to invoke such strong emotions from me. It resembles a mother awaiting her children who are off at war, only to be returned a flag for solace.

Yes	It opened my eyes to game developers being able to massively influence a person's opinion through thoroughly crafted storytelling. It's so subtle that most people who play the games wouldn't even realize it.	Yes				I think this is an excellent survey because it promotes the idea that games are more than what the majority of the world sees them as. They can be used as art, they can be used to teach, and they can be used to subtly push political ideas. I'm even partial to the idea that certain videogames are a better medium for storytelling compared to books and movies. To actually be present in the story your telling, and interact freely in the world of the story does so much more than a book or movie could ever do.	4506.64	58.17			25.38				14.9			1850.7													115.95		125.99		43.08		369.79								16.15		1075.88								140.82			669.83

Hellblade was a stark and vivid example of how a video game can do this. The totality of the game; story-line, music, art design, etc had such an unique and singular message of a woman battling through grief and mental illness, in one last attempt to rescue her love. Every beat you felt the raw emotion of the main protagonist, whether through facial expressions, words or the pace of the music. You became one with her and felt what she felt; did what she did. You became personally invested in her, and her story to the point where you almost felt you had experienced everything in real life.  The whole game is grounded in reality, despite it's Norse mythology setting. It was actually designed together with clinical psychologists and their insight really helped you feel and empathise with those who suffer from metal illness, whether past or present. It is a visceral experience, which cannot fully be described in words.

Though this just describes a single, specific game. There are numerous games out there, which equally provide you this same type of experience."

It helped me de-stigmatise both the sufferer and the disease itself, by helping me contextualise what it mean't to have these types of conditions. Through this, I was able to see both the difficulties they face in greater detail, but also the strength, fortitude and struggle these people face.	Yes	It provided myself, and from what I've heard a great deal others with a greater appreciation of the game which pushed the boundaries of what a game could be [show casing mental illness to a high degree of accuracy]. It showed the whole sector that a game could address an almost taboo and prejudiced area of the human condition, and can still be successful while providing a strong, powerful and positive message.	Yes	"It made me more away, and slightly more forgiving for my own mental health. It showed me that strength can still be found it this ""perceived weakness""."	No	Just added weight to my appreciation in this medium.	Yes	"I saw the behind the scenes, ""making of"" special features of the game and they explicitly stated so."			"I feel this is a long overdue study, as many of us who appreciate gaming have long spoken of the value and meaning that video games provide.

Upon succeeding, My character encountered and approached the elusive ""insulindian phasmid,"" a cryptid which the game had previously led you to believe was a mere fairy tale. I was able to hold up my hand to it, and using a skill which roughly translates into imagination, i was able to speak with the phasmid. From all the dialogue with the phasmid, I felt nothing but awe towards the creature and the universe at large-- it spoke of large heady concepts like human consciousness in the voice of a small-minded animal, which gave it much more of a feeling of natural wisdom being dispensed than artificial philosophical wankery. A quote that stands out especially to me is ""The anthropods [sic] are in silent and meaningless awe of you. Know that we are watching-- when you're tired, when the vision spins out of control.

Yes	Prior to this point in the game, the beauty point had been kind of buried. There was a lot of pessimistic depictions of the world and what it is like to be alive, but this moment added something of a ray of hope to the world of the game and the message it sent.	No	"When I say ""no,"" I mean there hasn't been any noteworthy long-term impact on me or my outlook. Whenever I read or experience something like that, I usually internalize its message for 2-3 weeks and then revert back to my old outlooks, and this was no exception."	No	I already had other similar experiences with other games, so experiencing a game as art was not a novel experience that would change my relationship with games. And since the message of this game has basically nothing to do with games themselves, my feelings about games have remained unchanged.	Yes	The in-game dialogue is the game element which evoked the experience, which means there had to be at least some intentionality in what we would intake, if not how we would react to it emotionally. But the tone and content of the writing leads me to believe that they had a specific message and a loose emotional response in mind.				1572	36.01			15.25				14.16			606.28													46.66		49.57		62.95		137.87								8.51		424.8								169.94

The game is clearly able to be analyzed through the lens of post colonialism, allowing me to consider how the portrayals of fictionalized native populations relates to the real world. I considered why they chose a colonialism focused game and what their intent was--what they wanted to say or how the wanted it to be interpreted. There is a clear attempt to create something marketable, but I do feel that analysis of the game allows for us to examine the human condition or at least or expectations as a society consuming such narratives in the 21st century.	Greedfall	Art should make us think and reflect. Art should be able to be analyzed critically and should tell us something about ourselves or the person(s) who create the art--things cultural, personal, historical, etc. Art is an artifact that encodes the spectrum of our humanity and asks us to face this truth.

The storyline could also be considered a work of art, albeit somewhat abstract. It made me feel contemplative, happy, sad, and nostalgic. Because it is a puzzle-based game, it made me think about the solution. Sometimes it was sort of frustrating, but I also played it while I was laying in bed, about to sleep.

However, it sticks out to me so much because before the trees are revived, the land is barren and grotesque and even fearsome at points, but when you revive the tree an animation plays where the tree quickly blooms and flowers/green grass/buildings sprout through the land. Accompanying it all is this excellent soundtrack and panorama of the newly-revived land. It makes goosebumps ripple throughout my body no matter how many times I see it.

The area was bright and foggy and blind creatures with anglerfish like features were lurking there, so I had to fly on momentum to avoid making sounds and disturb the creatures. The area had a weird effect, where spacial dimensions could alter from area to area and I had to reach a certain point of interest, while still hurrying up, because the sun would explode in another 6-10 minutes (the main loop of the game is 22 minutes long but there is no ingame timer).	Outer Wilds	Per definition, art is something that is man-made and supposed to primarily provoke thought or emotion.

There was an ancient race 200.000 years ago, that accidentally landed inside a strange structure. I was exploring that structure to find the crashed ship, the remnants of the crew and whatever technology they had. The scene wanted me to experience the dread, anxiety and sense of mortal danger the crew originally went through. I know this as opposed to just assuming, because at the end you find the logs of the crew, describing exactly that. The game does this all the time, first show and then tell through text logs.	Yes	While the game sure had me after ten minutes, this scene demonstrated impressively, that the developer sure knows how to evoke an emotion. I'm hard to scare, this one did a number on me.	Yes	It lingered with me for days.	Yes	I haven't been afraid while playing a video game in a long time. This one showed me it's still possible to scare me. I enjoyed that.	Yes	The scene was to elaborate to be by accident. The developers have demonstrated in other scenes, that they're very capable of getting their point across with high precision.			"I'm not sure the term ""art"" is defined sharply enough to be really relevant. It seems to me, that straw men like ""this is/isn't art"" pollute most debates in which they are brought up. I also think that the term ""art"" has been abused to generate revenue for far too long and it's time to understand, that mankind produces a lot of things, that serve no purpose but amuse and entertain (in the most basic senses of the words). It also creates a false sense of excellence, while it usually just means ""deemed art by those who reign over art"".
Thanks to social media, art is done by everyone for everyone. We now need to move on and develop methods of filtering regarding the phenotype and quality of works of art."	1589.24	45.7			21.45				13.69			273.98													47.95		62.13		37.26		240.5								8.73		237.88								46.86			553.11

In some maps of the game, there are lots of forests and some worse for wear villages, and although it's not something you would expect from this type of game, sometimes I just stop and marvel how beautiful and homely the foresty areas look. I also watch other people playing the game on Twitch, where sometimes they have tuned the visual filters in the game in a way that makes the bleak gray image of run down Russia look sunny, warm and beautiful, like a painting, especially in those forests with the branches moving in the wind.

No	This is an important aspect of them, and has always been. Even though everything has improved, especially the graphics, viddeo games have always made people feel they're a form of art when they are immersive. Consider a paint artist and a sandwich artist, games are way closer to the former.	Yes	It's all about being different, about finding your niche. The head developer of the game stands out to me as someone who believes in his creation as an ideal game of his, not because Mr Moneybags tells him to make it go a certain way. To me he is likeable, and the game is likeable, and that is probably where the sales people have been involed in, presenting their product in this way for people like me.

The experience had mostly been tragedy and despair and as such, this moment of hope in the game where allies join you to help you through an almost impossible situation is an awe-inspiring moment, combined with the music and the themes of the game being tied into the gameplay. 	NieR: Automata	I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.	2-11 months ago	No	During the end		N/A				N/A		3	1	5	5	5	1	5	5	5	1	2	2	4	1	1	5	5	5	3	5	1	5	5	1	3	5	1	5	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	5	5	1	1	1	5	5	N/A	18	20	100	100	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	No	Yes		NieR: Automata	Bloodborne	Hollow Knight	Outer Wilds	Celeste	No	No	Yes	I think the experience was supposed to convey the feeling that nobody is alone and it is easier to work together than alone.	Yes	The earlier events of the game are recontextualised and given more meaning and thus my overall opinion of the game is changed because of the final few minutes of it. My initial first impressions were also shown to be false.	Yes	It changed the way I view art and storytelling and gave me more appreciation for how interactivity is a unique tool for this. It also made me enjoy being more critical and questioning of works and stories.	Yes	"I did not consider digital games to be anything more than ""dumb fun"" before this event. Afterwards however, I consider them to be possible of much more than just fun."	Yes	The developer themself has spoken about this and confirmed it.

This is often achieved with themes, symbols, motifs, culture, and characters. I think games regularly accomplish this well. Shadow of The Colossus is a fantastic game I consider to be art. It uses a similar structure to the hero's journey but it has very little exposition or cutscenes, instead telling you the story by interacting with its world. Interaction is a technique videogames have unique access to over other mediums like film and games that use interaction well to tell their stories are often the most immersive and emotionally impactful. In Shadow of the Colossus, you navigate a vast foliage dense landscape on the hunt to defeat majestic titans roaming the land, the goal of which seems to be saving the life of a girl who has died. The more you defeat, the more you realize you are becoming the monster, the more you question if it's worth it. Your character becomes more dirty and disheveled as the journey progresses and by the end, you are a shell of your former self. You have defeated all the creatures to save the girl but in the process, you became a monster far worse than they ever were. The game ends with this happening literally.

The game is left heavily open to interpretation because of the lack of exposition and games that tell their stories almost solely through interaction are my favorite kind of art."	Shadow of the Colossus	"Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art."	2-11 months ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A																							4	5	4	4	4	1	4	3	2	1	4	3	2	1	3	4	1	1	4	3	4						N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A							N/A	N/A	N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A					1831.44	91.73			19.82				16.23			1576.78															126.88

An immersive unfolding of a mysterious plot, guided by the call of adventure and cryptic dreams from an enigmatic guide. 
Every dialogue, every cinematic freezes the frame of your surroundings and transports you to an illustrated book, in interactive fashion."	Baldur's Gate (1998)	"I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction."

Yes	"A game like this, as many others, has a level of depth to be unlocked by you, the player, with a specific mindset. Games are made with a certain purpose, a philosophy of design. You as a player need to remove any previous thoughts about what the game looks like and understand what it wants to be and, subsequently,  if that's any good.
Baldur's Gate is deeper than it looks after 1 hour, as well as after 10 hours or 30 hours. It's an acquired taste for one's mind and imagination."	Yes	Though I have played games like this before, this one posed a challenge, a mental one, and made me realise that all art takes a degree of challenge before you can understand it and then critique it.	Yes	It made me able to explore and understand different genres and niches better, and most importantly embrace them with open eyes.

After completing all 5 endings, I was relived it was over (and found deleting my save game file to help others strangely cathartic). But the game annoyed me overall and I didn't quite get why so many people recommended it so I looked up some articles/podcasts afters to try and understand this more. Overall I found the game rather pretentious and difficult to understand - but at the very least it seems to aspire to be art by trying to get players to question the purpose of life. After reading other articles, and responding to this question, it made me think that even if I didn't like it too much (didn't get on with the combat, found the storyline a bit too convoluted etc) I still see it as an example art due to the amount of creativity energy and thought that went into it - plus it attempted to do more than 'just' entertain.

No	It made me think a little differently about the game but I don't think it's had an impact beyond that. 	No	Not really. Though I guess it may affect some of my game choices in future i.e, I might be more likely to avoid similar titles!	Yes	I think they would probably have preferred I thought more about questions like what is life about during play - but yes, I think that it what they wanted players to consider when making the game.

The most recent example was basically the entire game of Papers Please, but especially the middle of the game, when the difficulty of the mechanics, the stress of providing for your family, and the moral pressure of protecting NPCs combined to create a poignant sense of despair.	Papers Pleaae	The competition between different pressures (described above), and possibly the drab color pallette and pixelation, made me feel a sense of despair that would not be possible outside of art, absent real personal tragedy.

I had spent a couple hours collecting items and talking to different characters to understand my own character's motivations and personality. When I reached the top the camera panned up and revealed a beautiful aurora. I was awestruck by it. Then the character pulled out their phone, finally having reception, and spoke with their mum. I don't remember what they spoke about but it was a heartfelt moment. I felt both responsible for providing my character this experience while simultaneously sharing the experience with the character. It was a mix of emotions from pride in myself for having overcome the primary obstacle of the game, to empathy for the character as they share a candid and vulnerable moment with a loved one. In combination with the breathtaking visuals it was an incredibly wholesome end that left me satisfied with the whole experience.	A Short Hike	It left a lasting impression on me.

It also represented the conclusion of the character's growth and how they'd come to accept the environment that they were in for the beauty, novelty, and differences that they were once critical of. I think it means that there's value in embracing the environment you find yourself in and making the most of it while you can. I think the vulnerability shared between the characters is representative of this. Opening up to the possibilities around you, whether they're from the environment or the people within it, can result in lasting emotional experiences. 	Yes	The game was cute and novel throughout the gameplay session and I enjoyed exploring the island but I didn't expect the ending to be as impactful as it was and I came away from the game with a much deeper respect for the experience as a whole. The end of the game contextualised the rest of the experience for me and I felt like I experienced the character's growth by being curious and exploring the island. 	No	It was an awesome experience to have and it's a fond memory when I think about it but beyond the initial emotional impact it hasn't had much of an impact on other areas of my life. 	No	I have a deep respect for what videogames are capable of and although it's nice to have another game I can point to when talking about games as art I think my general stance on games is the same. 	Yes	I don't think the game was intended to be ambiguous. Being an indie game I think it had an explicit goal for the gameplay and the emotional payoff at the end and the whole game was built around these experience goals. 				3888.46	97.07			79.18				49.64			1570.43													65.78		52.19		189.25		302.62								22.47		1170.46								217.46			71.91

It is a masterfully crafted game and by the credits I was left dumbfounded with just how much of an enjoyable experience it was.

Doom	I was engaged in the game from start to finish, and by the end I was left completely in awe at how good the game was.

I knew that it pioneered first person shooters and I knew that it is focused on gore much like Mortal Kombat is. The artistry and effort that was poured into Doom surprised me, though, and I am now a fan of the series as a whole.	Yes	Doom, among other games, sparked a recent interest of mine in game design and process of making a game.	No	Although it changed how I now approach the games I play, it has not changed my opinion on games. Games are art, just like movies, paintings, and books are.	Yes	As I said earlier, Doom was designed in a way that inspires a very specific feeling in the player. The Doomslayer is a force of nature, sent to hell to singlehandedly annihilate hordes upon hordes of demons. Doom makes you feel powerful while not removing challenge, and shows the player how powerful they are through the slapstick glory kills and chaos that ensues. Doom was clearly made with a very specific goal in mind, and it accomplished that goal with flying colors.				1489.16	121.44			26.19				7.86			460.67													54.38		69.84		3.29		215.5								9.38		347.99								139.99			32.63

As playing this game, it felt like the creator could fully establish his vision into the product. There no upgrade like level ups, or any additional equipment in this game, neither there are a lot of characters implemented into the game.
Nevertheless the game didn't get boring at all. Also the game forged an abnormal atmosphere which felt like forsaken sadness, due to the emptyness of the environment.
If I finally got to meet a character, it felt pleasurable for a moment, to not being alone anymore. Because of that, I really didn't want to fight the characters, but I had to do it instantly. This felt like kind of wrong, and this emotion gets increased by the sad music playing at the moment the opposing character dies.
In this game, winning does not feel like victory. I think that is exactly what the game tries to tell to the players. And that made me feel the gaming experience like art."	Shadow of the Colossus	"First of all, it is the uncommon atmosphere I noted above.

That's what makes it art... the people who made it loved making it, and made it the way it is for the sake of making something purely fun and cool and beautiful.

For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me ""me"", and what doesn't. When I saw the parent buff and read ""they will be there for you in your time of need"", I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can't change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it. This was technically a side quest."

Yes	It caused a bit of self reflection, and inspired me to look more into Carl Jung's shared consciousness theory. 	No	I've always seen video games as something that could be this powerful. I've grown up with them, watched games like Undertale come out. There's sincerely no room for the debate of whether or not games can be art. The only folks who think there is, tend to think the only video games are call of duty and fortnite.

I personally consider all of the above to be their own form of art. To me, art is a universal language through which the artist tries to convey a message through means like words in literature, human expressions in performances, sounds in music, or images (not pictures necessarily, the front of a construction is an image in itself), and many others. I have found that sculptures are an incredibly  powerful tool that can show emotions, and more importantly, create emotions on each person based on their perception of the piece. 	No	From my experience, video games built by teams of developers have a lot more in common with building a maze, or designing a board game than with painting a picture or writing a script for a theatrical play. Although, video games can contain, in my opinion, portions of art; original music, shots of landscapes, portrayal of situations, cinematics, voice-acting, etc. I guess I could compare this with a book of paintings, the book in itself isn’t art, but it does contain many pictures of real art.																																												11	45	74	73	No	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	Yes	No	No		1.- Dota 2	The Legend of Zelda				No	No	N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A		N/A				Interesting survey, although I found it a bit short.

The mechanics of the games being stripped back to their base basics necessitate the developers to spend their time and wow the player in other ways; and they mostly do that through soundtrack and visuals. I can think of so many moments from Life is Strange where I sat there, not playing the game, just watching the world around me; the people walking about, the perfectly-matched music blissfully playing away in the background, the story I'd been experiencing at the forefront of my mind as I immersed myself in the town of the game. Even to this day, no game has ever calmed me as much as Life is Strange has.	Life is Strange (Season 1)	If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. 	2-11 months ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		2	5	5	5	5	1	5	4	5	5	2	1	5	5	1	3	5	4	4	4	2	5	5	3	4	4	1	4	2	1	1	4	1	1	1	4	4	1	1	2	5	5	I can't describe this feeling any way; but I had a feeling of wanting permanence.

I was intended to be feeling deeply attached to this world for that reason.	Yes	The various moments elevated it from just another narrative story game with some choices to actual art for me, the entire game; there's not a moment of the game I wasn't deeply invested as a result.	Yes	I got emotional quite a lot throughout the game; I cried at the ending. In real life, I found it both cheered me up and depressed me greatly; to know that such a place is merely fiction and those people don't really exist.	Yes	It showed me that real emotional experiences can be done in games, and it helped me realise that the personal journey with a game is the most important thing when playing it. I used to focus more on getting things right in a game, getting the perfect ending but I've done a complete one-eighty now. I just want my story to be mine.	Yes	It's key to the ending choice of the game that you care deeply about the game's world, it's town, it's characters; and most of that building shines through in artful moments of absolute beauty. It was much very intended to make the ending several orders of magnitude more tense.			"I feel like a better definition of what 'as art' means at the start would help.

I've never really experienced a game that presented such heavy themes and philosophical concepts with such a simplistic and almost cute art style. It felt so unique to me and it made me question a lot of my own thoughts about life.	Night in the Woods	The game involves some very interesting themes such as becoming an adult, mental illnesses, accepting change, and questions existence and life and our place in the universe.

It was pixelated, top down. The story was incredible and powerful. I think it was made more powerful from the level of interaction I had with the story (which you wouldn't get with a film or a painting, which feels like very passive consumption). I felt like I personally was uncovering the twists and turns along with the characters.  It brought up themes of love, loss, regret in complicated nuanced ways, and I personally felt incredibly moved and I cried at points. The music was so well written and I feel like it wouldn't have had the same effect if the soundtrack didn't quite fit. I would rank this as one of the strongest emotional reactions I've ever had to a piece of media.  	To The Moon	"Art has been defined as ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" 
The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple. Therefore I believe it falls into that definition."	2-10 years ago	No	During the general gameplay		N/A				N/A		5	3	5	5	4	2	5	3	5	3	4	4	5	5	3	4	4	5	5	4	4	5	5	3	5	3	1	5	4	1	1	5	5	2	1	5	5	1	1	3	3	1		20	10	57	76	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	No		The Witcher Series	Borderlands Series	Mass Effect Series	The Longest Journey	Spyro The Dragon	No	No	Yes	I don't think it meant anything about me.

I was young still, but up to this point games we a very specific thing; this one is Mario, he steps on turtles and saves the princess, this one is Contra, they're soldiers fighting off aliens, this one is Metroid, a space soldier fighting aliens. But this one is art, you're not just moving from one level to the next, you're on the map, and every world is new and unique. Ghost houses, the sun has a face and it's mad at you, it attacks you, the every day enemies are now huge, you go to the sky and there is a castle in the clouds, a world of pipes, and a world of lava. The creativity of it all mixed into one game.	Super Mario Bros 3	I was young, so at the time, this title stood apart. The sun has a face and it wants to hurt you. A raccoon tail let you fly!

It's a high artistic game, where you explore with the character a world. What I found fascinating was high expressive images and environment used to comunicate emotions (grief) and the fact that the meccanics where though to play on the different aspect of the character. Basically, for each state of emotion, the world was modified around you, transforming elements already saw.  I think the powerful of comunicate emotions without need explanations or specific event, and the possibility to reuse previously known elements of the game In different ways was what make it such a unique experience.

It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story. (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.)  It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer. It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue. Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative. Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.). In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way. (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)	The Beginner's Guide	"I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art."	1-2 years ago	No	Other	During the general gameplay, but also the way the game is framed and 'marketed'	N/A				N/A		4	4	5	4	5	3	4	3	3	3	5	4	4	2	4	2	4	4	4	5	5	4	4	4	5	3	4	5	3	2	4	3	5	2	4	5	5	2	1	4	4	1	Admiration, for the developer	0	0	94	24	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	Genre non-conforming games	Virtual Virtual Reality	Undertale	The Stanley Parable	Accounting	Jazzpunk	Yes	Yes	Yes	It focuses on an aspect of the human condition that I think specifically affects creative people, and double-especially closet introverts suffering from impostor syndrome.

For certain games like Dear Esther, whose structure deliberately is designed to align more closely with those traditional modes of experience, I suppose the nature of the contemplation is similar... I wonder though if one could feasibly draw a new definition of contemplation for games like Call of Duty or League of Legends for example (just using the most well-known titles of their respective genre umbrellas), where contemplation may arise as a process through mechanical and symbolic repetition (the kind of ""flow"" that early game studies people loved to talk about). Another extension of that that I think is kinda interesting to think about is how players confront virtual worlds which seem to offer a near-realistic level of representation of reality (ie the uncanny valley as an incomplete sublime; or the experience of a bug/glitch/edge of the map as an experience analogous to the surrealist interrogation of reality), or how players understand seemingly ""endless"" worlds of immense computational scale, as with games like Minecraft or No Man's Sky (something to be said here maybe about Kant's mathematical sublime). 

In any case, best of luck with the study, looking forward to see the results!"	1358.53	55.95			13.49				5.21										209.93												113.35																					960.6

I valued being able to explore the space and become better acquainted with it, as if I really was spending an extended period of time at a real location.

There is one moment, however, which stood out. It took place at a farmhouse where the main character Conway talked to Weaver who lived at the farmhouse. Conway was looking for a hidden highway to deliver a shipment and Weaver needed someone to fix her TV.  The conversation quickly moved to the metaphysical realm and the TV started behaving strange. Then Weaver disappeared. As I was immersed in their discussion and wondered what had just happened, I prompted Conway to exit the farmhouse and move to another area and at that very time, silhouettes of musicians appeared in the foreground and they started playing a song. The mise-en-scène of that part of the game was simply crushing.

When I came back and unpaused the game, I looked over the edge of the mountain path I was riding along and sat there appreciating the scenery. The pine and fir trees, the river deep in the rocky yet smooth canyon, the wildlife around me, the audio of the birds chirping in the forest. It was extremely satisfying and it allowed me to forget my real life issues and just be at peace. I consider art to be a work that you can just get lost in, look at or listen to, and appreciate greatly. This is how I perceived the game at that point in time.

It was the first time I felt that a game narrative could make a case for digital game as art. It was very well thought-out and carefully driven throughout the game play experience and I still think it makes a powerful statement on the superior artistic syncretism that games can provide.

Yes	It was the first time that a First Person Shooter (FPS) game, which in general is a genre created for popular consumption, has well exceeded my expectations regarding the genre.	No	As a literary critic I tend to not have transformative experiences with art.	Yes	Only inasmuch as I played the game early in my life and I previously never given any thought to games as art.

Yes	There is an artistic intent recognizable in many video games, be it through the visual medium or through the script.

The body horror is immensly unsettling and detailed.	Dead Space 1	It felt like the art style had no intention of catering to anyones pleasure.

Everything is huge, much bigger than what you experienced in the game beforehand, with mountains and an orange-is surrounding. An enormous eagle-like machine flies high in the sky, while the valley is filled with both robots and animals, as well as few humans. Even though the character is in the middle of the screen, it is barely noticeable compared to the size of the scenery. 	Horizon: Zero Dawn	First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings.

The game's controls are very simple (there is one small choice at the end but otherwise the player can only move the player character around and occasionally interact with pieces of the set), but the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style, and the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player character's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed) person they miss; the player character walks this audience through daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee, tending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a hologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two interacted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are no longer sure of while the hologram degrades. While the letter speaks as though the addressee is alive and the two characters can see each other in the future, the narration has the emotional impact of an exploration of grief. After playing the game I immediately recommended it to some friends, telling them that the experience of playing it felt like the experience of reading a poem.	Under A Star Called Sun (by Cecile Richard)	The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.

Yes	I played this game the other week, so I'm not sure what its long-term impact on me will end up being, but in the short term, I've found myself coming back to thinking about it several times. With the stress of the pandemic death/grief-related media has been very difficult for me in general, but this one was poignant in a way that made it almost soothing to think about even though it had me in tears at the time I played it; rather than primarily making me afraid, it made me want to cherish the time I currently have with my loved ones.	No	I already considered digital games/video games an art form.	Yes	The game is built around its emotional core, and while the promotional post on Twitter that led me to the game did not describe it as a game about grief, the developer has called it that elsewhere since publishing it.				1574.02	44.56			14.32				12.38			658.89													46.76		47.35		26.56		157.14								9.06		452.69								87.66			16.65

The base one being a feeling of accomplishment as I completed puzzles and figured out solutions to all the different “experiments”. I also felt joy and happiness, both in completing puzzles that I struggled with and during the moments of dark comedy and deadpan humor. The sadness and feeling of “Oh it’s on now” upon seeing and figuring out that everyone in the enrichment center is dead and Doug Ratman is the sole survivor. 	Portal 2	I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway. Whereas playing Portal 2 made me truly happy with its comedy and I felt good about myself upon completing puzzles. It’s left a lasting impression that I’ll never forget.

People see video games as some mindless stupid thing for kids to enjoy. But really it can be deeper than that. Which unfortunately makes us surprised more often than not.	Yes	I’ve always view video games as an art form. Portal 2 went above and beyond to deliver that.	Yes	This can be seen as negative, but it made me more sarcastic and have a much darker sense of humor. But that’s the way I was before. I just masked it. But then I started playing video games and saw that what I was hiding was perfectly fine (situationally obviously, it’s not ok to make a terrorism joke during or just after a terrorist attack). I became more like myself in the end, and much like progression in video games more of me becomes open and unlocked for more I play. I become more of who I am.	No	I’ve already felt the way I did. 	Yes	Portal 2, and to a lesser extent the first Portal game, both were crafted to make the user feel. To not just be another 3D puzzle game where to complete the puzzle and get the cake at the end. Quite literally.				1652.26	76.7			18.72				13.21			872.65													48.78		49.32		3.28		109.05								11.4		335.55								94.99			18.61
