I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art.

"12",36,"Yes","One of the most immersive and intense game experiences I've had was while playing Subnautica. From the very start of the game (crash landing alone on an alien water planet), I truly felt emotions through my character. The game's illustrations, sounds, music, and narrative elements all evoked these emotions. At first I felt the loneliness, hopelessness, and panic: terrified of the horrors that I might encounter in the deep ocean if I ventured too far from my escape pod. I saw the edge of the shallow reef, at first too scared to dive deeper. I heard the chilling cries of large sea creatures echoing in the distance. But the game is about pushing your limits. Eventually I gained the equipment and confidence needed to progress to the next deeper, more dangerous area, but there was never a ""comfortable"" moment. Aside from the audio/visual elements, there is also a mystery about the planet that unfolds as you progress. The story is told through non-traditional narrative elements: your character receives clues and information about the mystery of the planet through scraps of recordings and artifacts, not through direct narration or dialogue. All these elements together kept me on the edge of my seat, adrenaline rushing, like I was truly there.","Subnautica","For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response. Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.","1-2 years ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"It changed my perspective on what video games can be in terms of immersion and evoking emotional response. Even though I had played other games I would consider immersive, in those other games I still felt emotionally detached from my character and the game as a whole.

It made me think of my own life and how similar I am to the character, and how brutal life in the Old West really was.","Red Dead Redemption 2","It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t.

At one point the mentor character explains that by helping people and taking on their burdens, you are teaching them to rely on other people's generosity for their survival. And one you have left they may actually be worse off. In contrast she also chastises you for overtly evil acts like winton violence.

The game never tells you outright what happened to the world or what's really going on. Instead it leaves little clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or characters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you start figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking about it or trying to find out more. It's like reading a good book, except you get to explore it all on your own at your own pace. The game left me with a sense of wonder and a lot of questions to think about. For instance, one of the main conflicts of the game is about sacrifice. Children are sacrificed to become void creatures in order to contain the Radiance, a deadly infection that would wipe out this whole world if left to spread. It's a similar problem to the trolley problem in philosophy.","Hollow Knight","The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.","2-11 months ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"I think it's up to subjective interpretation. The creators of the game don't consider any one of the endings of the game a ""true ending"". You have to decide to either try and defeat the infection to end this cycle, try to contain the infection within yourself in order to buy more time for the kingdom or become one with the void you were cast into as a child. That's really the big moral thing about the game, and the purpose is to consider the possibilities for yourself. With the game being as immersive as it is, the choices really feel like they have some weight. The game is also pretty difficult. The easiest ending is to stagnate things, and the hardest is to fight to end the infection. I think what the game means for me is that sometimes, there is no easy and kind way out of a situation. Some tragedies are bound to have victims and it's all we can do to try and minimize suffering. It's kind of bleak, to be honest. It also means to me that enacting change is very difficult, and you always have to kind of consider whether it's worth it to attempt it.","Yes","I started off thinking it was just an aesthetically pleasing metroidvania.

"28",81,"Yes","I experienced it as art because the game itself was very atmospheric, and the story and art style of the game was very emotive. I also liked that it made me think about things in a new way, as all good art does. It gave me the same feeling as visiting a gallery exhibition - like I understand another perspective on the world through the things I have seen. I felt like I understood the experience of living in a warzone much better, but more than that, I felt like the emotion had been captured and the bleak hopelessness mixed with hope that civilians experience came across as I played. The game itself had challenges and moral choices to be made, but gameplay wasn't difficult - I think that also contributed. If I'd been caught up in trying to WIN, I might not have paid so much attention to the feelings the game was creating.","This War of Mine","The fact that it gave me the same feeling as going to a gallery.

With it, it makes the game a work of art and deeply emotive and atmospheric, and very powerful. It means the game and my shift in emotion and perspective has stayed with me for years afterwards.","Yes","For the next day I was very moved. I had a new perspective and I was deeply saddened by everything in the game I had experienced, and the struggle of the characters I had witnessed. I was already aware that people in warzones suffered atrocities and deserved compassion, but this was an entirely new level of awareness of how tough it is to survive and how families and people are tested and sometimes destroyed in cruel ways.","Yes","I previously believed games could be works of art, but this is the first game I've ever played that moved me and made me think that games can change people's perspectives and can be that powerful. This game is a powerful work of art, not just a playful and beautiful thing but a dark and moving one that I wasn't sure was possible.","Yes","If you look at the art style and the story the game tells, you KNOW it was set up to have that huge emotional hit. There is no other reason they would have done that. They also include facts in the game, and links to charities, so it is obviously intended to inspire emotional change. Also, I've read interviews with the developers where they explain what they were going for - dark, atmospheric, emotional impact, new perspective and understanding ... in short, everything that I experienced.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"Rimworld","The Witcher series","Crusader Kings II",NA,NA

The emotional response of severe frustration is inevitable and intentional, and encourages thought about what the purpose of a game is.","Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy","As mentioned before the fact there was so clearly an intended emotional response, and that was linked to the an attempt to force the player to think about the purpose of games, about themself as a person makes it art.","<2 months ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"I haven't thought about it all too deeply, but I think the game is about the sort of player who ends up persevering through  the pain.

"31",87,"Yes","(I use a very wide definition of art, so I consider many forms of human expression or communicative endeavours to be art). I recently played a short game by Studio Oliomingus (sp.?) that  - to me anyway - had a wonderful way of communicating a narrative and a feeling of loss and melancholy through a surreal setting walking around weird buildings devoid of people but populated by giant old-fashioned telephones. 
Why is this art? Because it is an ""artefact"" that communicates something, I suppose. All man-made objects communicate, in some sense, but in this case it was definitely intentional :). It doesn't have to be as explicitly ""artistic"" as this game was in order to be art. I mean, Super Meat Boy or Super Mario Bros or some racing game or FIFA can be seen as art as well, IMO.","In the pause between the ringing","See above. My definition of art is very wide and probably includes most things that lend themselves to _interpretation_. Or can be percieved as metaphors. My, this is very theoretical all of a sudden.","<2 months ago","No","Other","as mentioned, it is pretty much a premise for all cultural products, so..","Do experiences mean things? I'm not sure I understand the question. I think the fact that I had a certain melancholic experience stems from certain narrative tropes combined with a certain aesthetic approach to storytelling that appeal to me and perhaps touched something inside me. What is melancholy? Some sort of nostalgic longing I suppose, perhaps without a concrete focus. The meaning was an emotion, to put it bluntly, and I'm not really sure that there is a deeper meaning that that to be pulled from that specific experience.","Yes","Since my playing of that game brought about certain emotions, I'd say that the experience and the emotion creates a kind of feedback loop, maybe? Also very theoretical, I guess, and I'm not sure I have the right words to nail the intersection of aesthetics, narrative, and experience, but I do think that it oscillates back and forth between the ""artwork"" and the ""perceiver""/""experiencer"" of that work.","No","It was a nice experience insofar as instilling certain emotions in me, but at the same time it was most definitely (to me) an aesthetic experience in the sense that the production/instilling of certain emotions seemed to be the purpose. If it had been grounded in, say, true stories of experienced oppression, climate change, joy at the birth of a child or something else, it might have hit a deeper note in me, possibly changing my viewpoints about a topic or prompting me to action in some way. As it were, this particular experience didn't.","No","I already percieve games as art, and that didn't change here. I'd say that I rarely encounter games with such a specific focus on instilling certain emotions, but it isn't a new experience for me.","Yes","Some kind of experience was intended, and I think many aspects of the game (as I recall it) plays into the melacholy/sadness/nostalgic longing that I remember. The retro-look of the huge telephones, the narrative you experience through them, the empty/vacant buildings that make up the world, paper planes flying about without purpose, perhaps even the red color of the phones. A general assumption is made here, namely that I and the developers share something, a common viewpoint or a lived experience or something similar. My 12 y.o. son would probably answer many of the questions in a different way, my 8 y.o. daughter perhaps even more so.

"36",116,"Yes","While almost every video game uses images and sound to convey information, video games as an art-form delves deeper than just simple communication. Art begin where the users own interpretation of the work affects how they perceive it. For my example game, the main character is left alone on a stormy island. As they explore the island, the narrator reads diary entries that give cryptic clues as to what happened on the island. Decorations amidst the island also fill in further details. The player is left to interpret what it all means, and based on the users life experiences might find that the story means one thing or another. This game touches on melancholy topics such as loneliness, depression, loss, and suicide, and in doing so teleports the user into the bleak lives of the narrator and his characters. The game gives no direct answers to what truly happened in the narrative, and upon finishing the game I was left with a strong sense of desolation. While it may sound like My example is artistic because it was cryptic or emotional, this is only the means by which the art of the game affected me. There was an ever-present sense of purpose and intent behind this game, and through its competencies I came to my own conclusions.","Dear Esther","Art leaves the user to reflect and interpret on it. While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful.

My general understanding was of a man speaking to a daughter-figure in his life about the dreary reality of living all alone on a remote island. The solitude drove him to a kind of insanity, a depression, that in the end drove him to suicide. The player, walking through the island and listening the the narrators voice the entire time, is walking the footsteps the narrator took on his last day before he eventually kills himself by jumping off the top of the island's radio beacon. The player however, as they jump off the beacon and just before they hit the ground, begins to fly into the sky. The music changes to a more uplifting feeling, and there seems to be a cathartic release. This to me is an expression of how suicide is romanticized in the mind of the person committing the act. A belief that killing yourself will make everything better. While I personally don't hold this perspective, this game transported me into the mind of someone who would think that way.

"42",141,"Yes","I feel like games, as a mixture of things we already consider art (music, literature, cinematography, etc), need to evoke something within the gameplay itself. Undertale does this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you not kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely heartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a game where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you can play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse: kill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that only a game could create: you've come to love all these characters, and now you want to see what happens when you personally kill them all. And you have to really try to do it: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two incredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly cheats). There are moments where the game points out that you, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant of these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY punished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist route, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes with a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the monster you created in the genocide route.","Undertale","To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art.

I might have grown as a person due to the topics discussed during the game, but those effects aren't apparent in everyday considerations.","Yes","It was another example that games can have more elements of a movie embedded into how they are built, and that it works.

It was clearly art to me because it didn’t just make me feel something at the end of the story. I was deeply moved by the game, haunted even. It has stuck with me to the same degree that any other mediums of art have.","Oxenfree","It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it.","1-2 years ago","No","During the end",NA,"It was just another instance of art moving me on a fundamental level. It meant the same to me as reading a beautiful novel or looking at a haunting painting. For me, art is generally a way to have directed emotional experiences.

Oxenfree, and artistic video games in general, are entirely indistinguishable in how they make me feel from what is universally accepted as art.","Yes","It helped me better understand my emotions.

I do appreciate accuracy. I also really enjoy the scenery in the game. A lot of it is based off of real life geography and it is all done beautifully and accurately.

There was less emphasis on the game play than there was on the emotions it evoked and the art style","Florence","Mostly what I described above. Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project.

The soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory, I think was up for a Grammy nomination. Every part of the game was crafted perfectly in order to elicit an emotional response, it is genuinely one of the best appeals to peace an environmentalism I've ever seen in a game. The lighting, the fluidity of movement, the bond that you feel between other players who you csnt even talk to, it all culminates in an experience that is nearly magical.","Journey","The quality of the worst that was put in as well as the over all experience of playing the game. The message also helped. It wasnt just a save the world type situation or a shoot and kill type game, even though technically it is a linear railroaded type game, it still gave you some agency of interpretation which I think is present in all art.","<2 months ago","Yes","During the beginning of the game",NA,"I don't know but I do think it was a call for environmentalism.","No","I've played this game roughly 15 times, theres very little at this point that can effect hoe I feel about it","No","Aside from taking a bit of time out of my day, no, I've read other studies about video games in regards to art.","No","See above response","Yes","It seems very clear given the in game sections that help explain the narrative.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess","Donkey Kong Country 2 for the snes","Journey","Final Fantasy 12","Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles"

You can appreaciate all aspects of this game from its visuals, to its story, to its soundtrack.","What Remains of Edith Finch","This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own.

Even my Grandmother could appreciate a good story.","Yes","I think the line can become blurred between what's a ""game"" and what is an ""experience"". Some games have no gameplay other than walking around, so called ""walking-simulators"" but they still require an amount of input.","Yes","The developers definitely intended to tell a story and highlight how games can be a medium for what would normally be considered more traditional story-telling, and then some.

"58",194,"Yes","The game involved exploring an island through the character of a man who recently lost his wife. While exploring the island, the man reads parts of letters sent to his wife, and slowly the story of his wife's death and of the island itself is revealed, though not wholly so. There is no 'game element' like a puzzle or a high score, and so it does seem questionable as to whether or not this is a game. Exploring the island is purely done on foot, and no running, only a slow walk. It never feels tedious however, as the game world is so intricately made and the dialogue is so engaging that the player is never bored.
The whole game can be played in a few hours. It left me somehow both melancholy and hopeful. The feelings generated from both the dialogue of the man and the images shown in the world were quite profound and stayed in my mind for the next few days. Right from the start, there was no point when I was not engrossed with the game, even though by all metrics it is slow. Though it is this slowness that allows each line of dialogue and part of the world to breathe; it is this that makes the game that much more impactful.","Dear Esther","The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.","<2 months ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"It may have been me planting my own feelings on to the game, but the experience made me melancholic to a point that I could not sleep before watching an episode of a cartoon..!

"59",201,"Yes","It was a scene where the two main characters had skipped school and boarded a cargo train as stowaways to reach some unknown destination. In the scene you were able to ask the  other main character some personal questions about their life, with which you gained insight to both their and your playable character’s inner thoughts and feelings. The scene had a mellow song playing in the background and once you were done asking the questions, you could keep listening to the song over and over and have the characters simply watching the changing scenery as the train kept moving. 

Watching the scene made me feel at ease and sent me back to some early preteen years when things felt a lot easier.

Possessed by an interdimensional being known as a traveller, Rayne is trying to cover up the murder the traveller forced him to commit. If the player doesn't have Rayne jailed, the game concludes with Rayne kidnapping you, planning to murder you so you cannot have him put in prison for the traveller's crime. In response, you can shapeshift into his closest friend, Bronwyn, to his shock. Resigned, he tells you he has no choice but to leave, in essence exiling himself so the traveller cannot return and he is not imprisoned. With a sad smile, he says ""I'll miss you the most"" and walks away, never to be seen again. I found this scene to be incredibly touching; Rayne is driven by his self-preservation and terror, yet is simultaneously unable to hurt Bronwyn even if refusing to do so puts him at risk. He cuts himself off from who he cares about most to protect them, and I think there's a beauty in that tragedy.","The Shapeshifting Detective","""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.","<2 months ago","Yes","During the end",NA,"This experience meant to me that we're all scared.

However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world.

Only for her to die alone and afraid in the Divine Beast as Ganon destroyed everything, likely calling out for help that came far far too late to truly rescue her.

"68",230,"Yes","The game is therefore art to me, because its narrative nature conveys emotions very well and sends the player on an emotional journey. 

Roughly speaking, it's about a narrator who shows the developed levels of someone else and thereby draws conclusions about the developer. 

Because of the open narrative style it also tempts more to empathize with the characters and think about how you would have behaved yourself. Thus the game becomes a very personal experience.

The short levels, which all leave a negative impression at first sight, can also mean something completely different on closer inspection. This also makes the game more and more detached from the author of the game and gives the player more and more control over what he makes of the game.","The beginners guide.","The feelings I felt while playing and the complete different feelings others felt while playing.","2-10 years ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"At first it began like a Standard walking simulator, but after a while it changed and the narration got way more personal.","Yes","I cried while playing the end of the game.","Yes","A friend of me was in a very similar situation that is described in the game.","Yes","Games can transport emotions so much better than movies or images.","Yes","I think I'm this game every experience is intended by the developer.

"69",232,"Yes","After having reached every main ending of the game, the story takes a grim turn and leaves you feeling hopeless since pretty much every main character ends up dead or in a complete state of misery. Just as this happens, the credits start to roll and you actually play as a little spaceship shooting the words on screen. However, even now you remain hopeless because it's impossible to win. You lose again and again, having to repeat the same process over and over - pretty much mirroring the hardships the main characters had to go trough - and just as you start to become really frustrated and are about to give up, messages from other players all around the world start to appear. All these messages contain positive thoughts, urging you on to not give up and keep on going. As these messages become more and more, you start to realize that you are not alone in this, there are thousand of others around the globe, stuck in the same struggle that you are - until finally, you get help in form of other spaceships circling around yours, rendering the shooting section, which seemed impossible to overcome just a moment ago, incredibly easy. Thus you beat the final ""boss"", the credits, of the game and get to see the true ending, in which the main characters get reassembled and wake up to live another day.","Nier Automata","The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.","1-2 years ago","Yes","During the end",NA,"For me personally, it meant the world to me - i had just lost a close family member and was stuck in a really dark place, pretty much having given up on any hope of positive change. That is why i felt so connected to these characters who were stuck in a grim and hopeless world, in an endless loop of struggle and death. When in the end, these characters all survived, thanks to the actions of another player - in a strictly singleplayer game with no online functionality what so ever outside of this experience - i, too, felt that there was hope. Hope for humanity as a whole, hope for better days. Hope for myself. 
On a less personal level, i think the experience was also a thank you from the creator - Yoko Taro - to the players of his games. In pretty much every game he created, the main characters do not get to enjoy a happy ending. It always ended in suffering, for both the characters, the world they life in and the player. Also, all these games are losely connected (From the Drakengard series to Nier and Nier Automata), taking place in the same universe. So the player fighting the credits, the names of those who created the game, was the players fight for a happy ending. A happy ending for these characters you grow so attached to over the course of the game - the ending they deserved after years of sad endings in Yoko Taros video games.","Yes","Before the ending, i saw the game as an incredible experience already - an amazing story coupled with the trademark smooth and flashy Platinum Games gameplay.

"70",235,"Yes","The game starts with the protagonist narrating his history within the universe and detailing the main events of the previous game, already the slides presented show comic book style panels with interactive bits to shape they way the first game happened in a streamlined way. Afterwards you're shown a cutscene showing the Normandy, your ship being attacked by an unknown vessel of uniquely alien design resembling a sort of wasp hive built around a massive laser beam canon. The Normandy and it's crew are in grave peril with everyone scrambling to make repairs, bark out orders, or get to the escape pods. You are then moved to your character, Commander Shepard, a calm and steady leader whose face you cannot see behind his military grade space suit. While you make your way to the bridge to retrieve the pilot of the Normandy you see flames and pylons scarrtered throughout the ship leading up to the cock pit. As you enter the CIC (Combat Information Center, the place you used to navigate your ship through the galaxy) you are met with an immediate contrast to the blaringly loud, creaking, flaming ship into the silent vacuum of space. The entire ceiling has been ripped off, the artificial gravity isn't working in this section and you walk at almost a snails pace across to the cockpit. The only sounds you can hear are your own breathing through your helmet and the ship gets almost completely dark until you emerge at the other end finding the pilot. You convince him that the Normandy is gone and there's nothing he can do and safely get him to the last escape pod but you're not so lucky. One final blast from the alien ship sends you hurtling towards the planet below. Nobody is able to rescue you, your air tank has been breached and you're falling into the gravity well of the planet in a blaze. This is Mass Effect.","Mass Effect 2","The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment.

You spend the majority of the game trying to fulfill this prerequisites you must complete before Satan will accept your challenge. At the very end of the game, when you go to finally challenge Satan, you find that he is in the middle of an intervention for alcoholism by the other residents of Hell. Satan refuses to admit that he has a problem, and challenges the player to a drinking game, which I initially refused to participate in out of not wanting Satan’s substance abuse issues to become worse (I have had people in my life who have had problems with alcohol.) Satan will then inform the player that if they refuse to compete, then they will remain dead forever and will not be revived for being virtuous. I realized immediately due to experiences with other games by this creator that this was not a bluff, but instead a legitimate warning. After losing, Satan will allow you to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan and felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing the other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled Satan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I had done the right and just thing. I always like to win, I’m a very competitive person, and I have a deep rooted fear of death and failure (my two biggest fears) - I had defeated my insecurities and accomplished what I set out to, but at the cost of knowing that I had become the kind of destructive presence for Hell that I absolutely despise from people in the real world.

"76",268,"Yes","Mechanically, Rimworld is a base-building, colony management sim game. Experientially, the game invites you to be the co-author of a story. Importantly to the experience, the pacing of the story is controlled by the game, but many of the elements are left with the player (colony creation, quest decisions), or left to the player to decide if they'd like to author them or leave them to the game to manage (pawn names, optional micromanagement like schedules - which have an impact on the relationships between pawns over time).

The world is vibrant and varied and clearly sculpted with a lot of care.  I would think the game devs would love to know that the work is appreciated.  But I know they must have wanted to show off the world because there are a few gameplay elements that make it necessary: 1) the main character has a camera and taking pictures of animals, plants, and monsters is a required part of the game to fill your encyclopedia and to complete some quests, and 2) the wide game world is speckled with little critters called koroks that hide around the map in strange places.  They are found on the tops of tall trees, in rock circles, in the water, all over ever inch of the world.

I wanted there to be a happy ending, a way in which both characters step away contented. But in truth, the ending is almost hallow, a real gut punch.

The narrative of the game and its writing wrestled with issues of morality, class, racism, sexism, and many other topics in ways that many other video games have been afraid to touch. The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralt’s reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of art’s tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before.

I also loved the character and clothing designs in the game, and appreciated the time and thought that obviously went into creating them.","Breath of the Wild.","I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings.

"95",353,"Yes","I was watching a Twitch stream, so someone else was playing the game. I remember being completely fascinated by the visual aesthetics: it was somewhat dark and gloomy, yet so magically beautiful. My thoughts at that moment went to Kants descriptions of sublime: it was threatening and dangerous, yet beautiful. i knew if i were playing i would be nervous and stressed to do well, but i found the graphics to be incredibly enchanting, even dreamy. The setting was nature, with a lot of contrast between light and dark, some sharp edges and cloud-like appearance of the lighter areas, with tiny specs of light floating around. I felt nervous excitement about the game play and calm serene feeling at the same time due to graphics. My focus was torn between wanting the character to perform well and the admiration of visual aesthetics. There were mostly two feelings, a discrepancy between both, I was afraid and mesmerized at the same time.

"96",358,"Yes","I experienced the game Night in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual moments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the experience of living in a small provincial town without prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express this, and then to transform this into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create an experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics helped me to physically identify with the main character, and encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And the experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have in my own home town. I think this physical identification helped create space for a psychological identification with a complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In conversations with ""my"" family I wanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between this and living as ""myself"" in this town, under these emotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game are all about building and maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining your identity - they do not affect your ""progress""  or achievements as such - this captures something fundamental about daily life I think - most of our choices are like this. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it an object of reflection. 


When playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it was creating a language for itself, and about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative overreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game where I could see a distinct language for games being created in a similar way. In this case a language of agency and constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own agency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions. 
The light platforming and exploration element is again important in this - it brings an element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively point and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a really effective tension between freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and expresses the themes and experience of the art.
There is a scene at a party which captures this well - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you can only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time - you have been away from these people for years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by your past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the knowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene written so convincingly that the effect of these forced choices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in the game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't think of another work of art which captures the experience of being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well. The scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and familiar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming conventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in a way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And most interestingly it leverages features of gaming which some have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is a small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works with the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an experience quite forcefully.","Night in the Woods","The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.","1-2 years ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"It articulated the way that we are often constrained by our circumstances and our history, the way that making peace with that is difficult, the way that it is hard not to blame ourselves and others for behaviours which follow from our circumstances, the ambiguity of agency in these circumstances, and its complex situatedness in a world, a set of economic conditions, and a way of life.","Yes","I think this scene was the moment which made me see these themes throughout the rest of the game.  It also made me see how simple, non technical aspects of gaming can create profound opportunities for reflection and experience, and allowed the game to act as an exemplar for me in thinking about the kind of work I want to make.","Yes","I grew up in a similar town (albeit in Britain), so it captured and helped me process my feelings about that place. It also helped me to reflect on my behaviour when younger.","Yes","It made me take games seriously as a grassroots artistic medium, rather than a bland, gate-kept big money theme park.

I saw that games were becoming for a lot of people what popular music was for a while.","Yes","I've subsequently read interviews and writing by the developers and they talk about things very close to this.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"Chrono Trigger","Night in the Woods,","A Short Hike","Zelda: Breath of the Wild","Secret of Mana"
"97",361,"Yes","The choice near the end of Part 1 of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (on the Black Eagle route) where you decide whether to side with Edelgard or Rhea. The experiences with the game's characters up to that point (in overall plot scenes, single-character support dialogues, and even small in-battle dialogue), overarching plot, and even visual/music cues made it feel like a very significant decisive moment. (In hindsight, it's a bit surprising that a statement like ""This decision will drastically alter the story."" wasn't immersion-breaking, but with the overall quiet except for a 'heartbeat' sound, it made it work. And I only just realized while writing this that at that point, the main character doesn't have a heartbeat.) The parts immediately leading up to it and reactions afterward also had excellent voice acting that were great at bringing out the right emotional effects for me. (Other, more 'meta' realizations like that I wouldn't have liked the scene nearly as much with a male main character didn't come until quite a bit later.) Also, I honestly didn't have a whole lot of doubt about what I would decide, but it still felt very heavy and significant. (I sided with Edelgard. Just so you know.)","Fire Emblem: Three Houses","I can't entirely say, since I don't have a particularly concrete definition (it strikes me as one of those frustratingly vague things like gender, and not something that can clearly be defined in a sentence or two), but it evoked at least as much emotional impact in me as other media experiences (books, movies, etc.) that I know typically are considered art, so it seems to fit to me.","2-11 months ago","Yes","Other","During a pivotal cutscene near the end of the first half of the game","Ultimately, I think it's asking both how you feel about the characters in question, and possibly more broadly about whether you will fulfill a given purpose/destiny or fight against it.

"105",393,"Yes","Art is at it's base level, a media in which to invoke an emotional reaction. Hellblade was a stark and vivid example of how a video game can do this. The totality of the game; story-line, music, art design, etc had such an unique and singular message of a woman battling through grief and mental illness, in one last attempt to rescue her love. Every beat you felt the raw emotion of the main protagonist, whether through facial expressions, words or the pace of the music. You became one with her and felt what she felt; did what she did. You became personally invested in her, and her story to the point where you almost felt you had experienced everything in real life.  The whole game is grounded in reality, despite it's Norse mythology setting. It was actually designed together with clinical psychologists and their insight really helped you feel and empathise with those who suffer from metal illness, whether past or present. It is a visceral experience, which cannot fully be described in words.

Upon succeeding, My character encountered and approached the elusive ""insulindian phasmid,"" a cryptid which the game had previously led you to believe was a mere fairy tale. I was able to hold up my hand to it, and using a skill which roughly translates into imagination, i was able to speak with the phasmid. From all the dialogue with the phasmid, I felt nothing but awe towards the creature and the universe at large-- it spoke of large heady concepts like human consciousness in the voice of a small-minded animal, which gave it much more of a feeling of natural wisdom being dispensed than artificial philosophical wankery.

"111",411,"Yes","I reflected on the world created in the game and the use of the narrative and visuals to explore that world. The game is clearly able to be analyzed through the lens of post colonialism, allowing me to consider how the portrayals of fictionalized native populations relates to the real world. I considered why they chose a colonialism focused game and what their intent was--what they wanted to say or how the wanted it to be interpreted.

Overall I found the game rather pretentious and difficult to understand - but at the very least it seems to aspire to be art by trying to get players to question the purpose of life. After reading other articles, and responding to this question, it made me think that even if I didn't like it too much (didn't get on with the combat, found the storyline a bit too convoluted etc) I still see it as an example art due to the amount of creativity energy and thought that went into it - plus it attempted to do more than 'just' entertain.","Nier Automata","See above","<2 months ago","No","Other","After playing","Not sure how to answer this as my experience was pretty much about reflecting on the game as a whole in terms of what it 'meant'.","Yes","I would not say I enjoyed playing the game overall (though I did enjoy some moments of it).

I don't remember what they spoke about but it was a heartfelt moment. I felt both responsible for providing my character this experience while simultaneously sharing the experience with the character.

"135",512,"Yes","The game tries not to reach a big target audience as other games are trying. As playing this game, it felt like the creator could fully establish his vision into the product. There no upgrade like level ups, or any additional equipment in this game, neither there are a lot of characters implemented into the game.
Nevertheless the game didn't get boring at all. Also the game forged an abnormal atmosphere which felt like forsaken sadness, due to the emptyness of the environment.
If I finally got to meet a character, it felt pleasurable for a moment, to not being alone anymore. Because of that, I really didn't want to fight the characters, but I had to do it instantly. This felt like kind of wrong, and this emotion gets increased by the sad music playing at the moment the opposing character dies.

"142",537,"Yes","There's many instances I could site, but my favorite so far has been the whole story of The Secret World. For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me ""me"", and what doesn't. When I saw the parent buff and read ""they will be there for you in your time of need"", I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can't change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it.

"161",612,"Yes","The game explores what it is to be a player and/or a creator. It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story. (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.)  It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer. It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue. Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative. Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.). In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way. (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)","The Beginner's Guide","I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.","1-2 years ago","No","Other","During the general gameplay, but also the way the game is framed and 'marketed'","It focuses on an aspect of the human condition that I think specifically affects creative people, and double-especially closet introverts suffering from impostor syndrome.

While the experience might not have been perceived the same way by everyone, such a beautiful view is always in tented, as it requires a lot of work.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"The last of us","Horizon: Zero Dawn","The Witcher 3","GTA V",NA

","Skyrim","Defining what art is is super subjective, but to me this counted because 1. people had to create those graphics, and 2 .

"171",667,"Yes","The game and it's graphics, music and story made me feel calm and happy in a way nothing else could at the time. Playing it felt like a journey to another, better place, and that's art to me.","Ori and the blind forest","It made me feel the same way as art does.

"172",668,"Yes","The most recent instance where I experienced a digital game as art it was a short (roughly 5-10 minutes) indie game about a person alone on a spaceship. The game's controls are very simple (there is one small choice at the end but otherwise the player can only move the player character around and occasionally interact with pieces of the set), but the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style, and the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player character's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed) person they miss; the player character walks this audience through daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee, tending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a hologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two interacted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are no longer sure of while the hologram degrades. While the letter speaks as though the addressee is alive and the two characters can see each other in the future, the narration has the emotional impact of an exploration of grief. After playing the game I immediately recommended it to some friends, telling them that the experience of playing it felt like the experience of reading a poem.","Under A Star Called Sun (by Cecile Richard)","The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.","<2 months ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"I think it means that, while this game of course would not have affected all potential players in the same way, it tapped into something about a widely shared struggle with loss and impermanence.","Yes","I'm not sure how the emotional impact a game had on me could *not* affect how I viewed the game; the emotional impact is part of the game.","Yes","I played this game the other week, so I'm not sure what its long-term impact on me will end up being, but in the short term, I've found myself coming back to thinking about it several times. With the stress of the pandemic death/grief-related media has been very difficult for me in general, but this one was poignant in a way that made it almost soothing to think about even though it had me in tears at the time I played it; rather than primarily making me afraid, it made me want to cherish the time I currently have with my loved ones.","No","I already considered digital games/video games an art form.","Yes","The game is built around its emotional core, and while the promotional post on Twitter that led me to the game did not describe it as a game about grief, the developer has called it that elsewhere since publishing it.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"Journey","Okami","Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask","Transistor","Shadow of the Colossus"
"173",669,"Yes","Minecraft itself does not have to be art because there are so many things you can do on it, but it inspires a lot of art. I see people making rube Goldberg machines, castles, floating islands, secret bases, and using command blocks to create visually pleasing videos with swirling rainbows and messages, and really any kind of visual art including 3d and moving can be created","Minecraft","The people making these builds and sharing them are not doing it for any other purpose than art because they are impractical for fighting mobs or gaining resources or anything else in the game","<2 months ago","Yes","During the end",NA,"People have a creative outlet in a new way","Yes","I didn't know a lot of that stuff was possible and now I want to try doing similar things","Yes","Sort of inspired me to keep playing the game to get to the point I see other people at","No","Doesn't really apply to other games","Yes","A lot of the blocks in the game are decorative and don't serve any purpose other than art.

"174",674,"Yes","The game made me feel a range of emotions throughout. The base one being a feeling of accomplishment as I completed puzzles and figured out solutions to all the different “experiments”. I also felt joy and happiness, both in completing puzzles that I struggled with and during the moments of dark comedy and deadpan humor. The sadness and feeling of “Oh it’s on now” upon seeing and figuring out that everyone in the enrichment center is dead and Doug Ratman is the sole survivor.","Portal 2","I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway. Whereas playing Portal 2 made me truly happy with its comedy and I felt good about myself upon completing puzzles. It’s left a lasting impression that I’ll never forget.","<2 months ago","Yes","During the general gameplay",NA,"That video games aren’t treated as what they are, as art. People see video games as some mindless stupid thing for kids to enjoy. But really it can be deeper than that. Which unfortunately makes us surprised more often than not.","Yes","I’ve always view video games as an art form. Portal 2 went above and beyond to deliver that.","Yes","This can be seen as negative, but it made me more sarcastic and have a much darker sense of humor. But that’s the way I was before. I just masked it. But then I started playing video games and saw that what I was hiding was perfectly fine (situationally obviously, it’s not ok to make a terrorism joke during or just after a terrorist attack). I became more like myself in the end, and much like progression in video games more of me becomes open and unlocked for more I play. I become more of who I am.","No","I’ve already felt the way I did.","Yes","Portal 2, and to a lesser extent the first Portal game, both were crafted to make the user feel. To not just be another 3D puzzle game where to complete the puzzle and get the cake at the end. Quite literally.","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,"War Thunder","Portal 2","Ravenfield","Hearts of Iron 4","Borderlands 2"
