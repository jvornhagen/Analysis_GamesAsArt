From the very start of the game (crash landing alone on an alien water planet), I truly felt emotions through my character. The game's illustrations, sounds, music, and narrative elements all evoked these emotions. At first I felt the loneliness, hopelessness, and panic: terrified of the horrors that I might encounter in the deep ocean if I ventured too far from my escape pod. I saw the edge of the shallow reef, at first too scared to dive deeper. I heard the chilling cries of large sea creatures echoing in the distance. But the game is about pushing your limits. Eventually I gained the equipment and confidence needed to progress to the next deeper, more dangerous area, but there was never a ""comfortable"" moment. Aside from the audio/visual elements, there is also a mystery about the planet that unfolds as you progress. The story is told through non-traditional narrative elements: your character receives clues and information about the mystery of the planet through scraps of recordings and artifacts, not through direct narration or dialogue. All these elements together kept me on the edge of my seat, adrenaline rushing, like I was truly there.","Subnautica","For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response.

Each area of the game is distinct and evokes some kind of feeling - anxiety, calm, happiness, nostalgia. Each area has beautiful, distinct music. Colour is also used to differentiate the areas. The mood is crafted carefully and very successfully. It really is easy to get lost just exploring the world and learning about it. The writing is probably even better, to be honest. The game never tells you outright what happened to the world or what's really going on. Instead it leaves little clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or characters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you start figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking about it or trying to find out more. It's like reading a good book, except you get to explore it all on your own at your own pace. The game left me with a sense of wonder and a lot of questions to think about. For instance, one of the main conflicts of the game is about sacrifice.

You have to decide to either try and defeat the infection to end this cycle, try to contain the infection within yourself in order to buy more time for the kingdom or become one with the void you were cast into as a child. That's really the big moral thing about the game, and the purpose is to consider the possibilities for yourself. With the game being as immersive as it is, the choices really feel like they have some weight. The game is also pretty difficult. The easiest ending is to stagnate things, and the hardest is to fight to end the infection. I think what the game means for me is that sometimes, there is no easy and kind way out of a situation. Some tragedies are bound to have victims and it's all we can do to try and minimize suffering. It's kind of bleak, to be honest.

Why is this art? Because it is an ""artefact"" that communicates something, I suppose. All man-made objects communicate, in some sense, but in this case it was definitely intentional :).

The meaning was an emotion, to put it bluntly, and I'm not really sure that there is a deeper meaning that that to be pulled from that specific experience.","Yes","Since my playing of that game brought about certain emotions, I'd say that the experience and the emotion creates a kind of feedback loop, maybe?

As they explore the island, the narrator reads diary entries that give cryptic clues as to what happened on the island. Decorations amidst the island also fill in further details. The player is left to interpret what it all means, and based on the users life experiences might find that the story means one thing or another. This game touches on melancholy topics such as loneliness, depression, loss, and suicide, and in doing so teleports the user into the bleak lives of the narrator and his characters. The game gives no direct answers to what truly happened in the narrative, and upon finishing the game I was left with a strong sense of desolation.

My general understanding was of a man speaking to a daughter-figure in his life about the dreary reality of living all alone on a remote island.

The player, walking through the island and listening the the narrators voice the entire time, is walking the footsteps the narrator took on his last day before he eventually kills himself by jumping off the top of the island's radio beacon. The player however, as they jump off the beacon and just before they hit the ground, begins to fly into the sky. The music changes to a more uplifting feeling, and there seems to be a cathartic release. This to me is an expression of how suicide is romanticized in the mind of the person committing the act.

"36",141,25,"Non-Binary",NA,5,"Yes","I feel like games, as a mixture of things we already consider art (music, literature, cinematography, etc), need to evoke something within the gameplay itself. Undertale does this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you not kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely heartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a game where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you can play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse: kill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that only a game could create: you've come to love all these characters, and now you want to see what happens when you personally kill them all. And you have to really try to do it: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two incredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly cheats). There are moments where the game points out that you, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant of these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY punished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist route, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes with a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the monster you created in the genocide route.","Undertale","To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.","1-2 years ago","Yes","Other","A second playthrough","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,3,1,3,1,5,5,2,3,3,1,3,4,4,1,4,2,4,1,3,3,2,3,2,4,4,2,2,4,1,2,1,4,4,1,3,4,1,2,4,4,1,2,NA,23,50,100,100,"Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes",NA,"Undertale","Doom Eternal","Dark Souls","Etrian Odyssey III","Persona 4 Golden","No","No","Yes",NA,"N/A",NA,"N/A",NA,"N/A",NA,"N/A",NA,NA,1676.51,71.94,NA,NA,13.53,NA,NA,NA,12.12,NA,NA,1348.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36.9,NA,40.19,NA,4.61,NA,142.62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While exploring the island, the man reads parts of letters sent to his wife, and slowly the story of his wife's death and of the island itself is revealed, though not wholly so. There is no 'game element' like a puzzle or a high score, and so it does seem questionable as to whether or not this is a game. Exploring the island is purely done on foot, and no running, only a slow walk. It never feels tedious however, as the game world is so intricately made and the dialogue is so engaging that the player is never bored.
The whole game can be played in a few hours. It left me somehow both melancholy and hopeful. The feelings generated from both the dialogue of the man and the images shown in the world were quite profound and stayed in my mind for the next few days.

With a sad smile, he says ""I'll miss you the most"" and walks away, never to be seen again.

You lose again and again, having to repeat the same process over and over - pretty much mirroring the hardships the main characters had to go trough - and just as you start to become really frustrated and are about to give up, messages from other players all around the world start to appear. All these messages contain positive thoughts, urging you on to not give up and keep on going. As these messages become more and more, you start to realize that you are not alone in this, there are thousand of others around the globe, stuck in the same struggle that you are - until finally, you get help in form of other spaceships circling around yours, rendering the shooting section, which seemed impossible to overcome just a moment ago, incredibly easy.

Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped.

Hope for humanity as a whole, hope for better days. Hope for myself. 
On a less personal level, i think the experience was also a thank you from the creator - Yoko Taro - to the players of his games. In pretty much every game he created, the main characters do not get to enjoy a happy ending. It always ended in suffering, for both the characters, the world they life in and the player. Also, all these games are losely connected (From the Drakengard series to Nier and Nier Automata), taking place in the same universe.

Afterwards you're shown a cutscene showing the Normandy, your ship being attacked by an unknown vessel of uniquely alien design resembling a sort of wasp hive built around a massive laser beam canon. The Normandy and it's crew are in grave peril with everyone scrambling to make repairs, bark out orders, or get to the escape pods. You are then moved to your character, Commander Shepard, a calm and steady leader whose face you cannot see behind his military grade space suit. While you make your way to the bridge to retrieve the pilot of the Normandy you see flames and pylons scarrtered throughout the ship leading up to the cock pit. As you enter the CIC (Combat Information Center, the place you used to navigate your ship through the galaxy) you are met with an immediate contrast to the blaringly loud, creaking, flaming ship into the silent vacuum of space. The entire ceiling has been ripped off, the artificial gravity isn't working in this section and you walk at almost a snails pace across to the cockpit. The only sounds you can hear are your own breathing through your helmet and the ship gets almost completely dark until you emerge at the other end finding the pilot. You convince him that the Normandy is gone and there's nothing he can do and safely get him to the last escape pod but you're not so lucky.

You spend the majority of the game trying to fulfill this prerequisites you must complete before Satan will accept your challenge. At the very end of the game, when you go to finally challenge Satan, you find that he is in the middle of an intervention for alcoholism by the other residents of Hell. Satan refuses to admit that he has a problem, and challenges the player to a drinking game, which I initially refused to participate in out of not wanting Satan’s substance abuse issues to become worse (I have had people in my life who have had problems with alcohol.) Satan will then inform the player that if they refuse to compete, then they will remain dead forever and will not be revived for being virtuous. I realized immediately due to experiences with other games by this creator that this was not a bluff, but instead a legitimate warning. After losing, Satan will allow you to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan and felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing the other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled Satan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I had done the right and just thing. I always like to win, I’m a very competitive person, and I have a deep rooted fear of death and failure (my two biggest fears) - I had defeated my insecurities and accomplished what I set out to, but at the cost of knowing that I had become the kind of destructive presence for Hell that I absolutely despise from people in the real world.

The setting was nature, with a lot of contrast between light and dark, some sharp edges and cloud-like appearance of the lighter areas, with tiny specs of light floating around. I felt nervous excitement about the game play and calm serene feeling at the same time due to graphics. My focus was torn between wanting the character to perform well and the admiration of visual aesthetics. There were mostly two feelings, a discrepancy between both, I was afraid and mesmerized at the same time.

"93",358,38,"Man",NA,5,"Yes","I experienced the game Night in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual moments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the experience of living in a small provincial town without prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express this, and then to transform this into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create an experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics helped me to physically identify with the main character, and encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And the experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have in my own home town. I think this physical identification helped create space for a psychological identification with a complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In conversations with ""my"" family I wanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between this and living as ""myself"" in this town, under these emotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game are all about building and maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining your identity - they do not affect your ""progress""  or achievements as such - this captures something fundamental about daily life I think - most of our choices are like this. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it an object of reflection. 


When playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it was creating a language for itself, and about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative overreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game where I could see a distinct language for games being created in a similar way. In this case a language of agency and constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own agency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions. 
The light platforming and exploration element is again important in this - it brings an element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively point and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a really effective tension between freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and expresses the themes and experience of the art.
There is a scene at a party which captures this well - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you can only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time - you have been away from these people for years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by your past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the knowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene written so convincingly that the effect of these forced choices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in the game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't think of another work of art which captures the experience of being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well. The scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and familiar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming conventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in a way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And most interestingly it leverages features of gaming which some have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is a small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works with the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an experience quite forcefully.","Night in the Woods","The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.","1-2 years ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,4,5,5,3,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,3,5,2,4,4,5,4,2,5,5,3,1,5,5,1,2,5,3,1,1,5,4,5,"I felt inspired to create.

The experiences with the game's characters up to that point (in overall plot scenes, single-character support dialogues, and even small in-battle dialogue), overarching plot, and even visual/music cues made it feel like a very significant decisive moment. (In hindsight, it's a bit surprising that a statement like ""This decision will drastically alter the story."" wasn't immersion-breaking, but with the overall quiet except for a 'heartbeat' sound, it made it work. And I only just realized while writing this that at that point, the main character doesn't have a heartbeat.) The parts immediately leading up to it and reactions afterward also had excellent voice acting that were great at bringing out the right emotional effects for me. (Other, more 'meta' realizations like that I wouldn't have liked the scene nearly as much with a male main character didn't come until quite a bit later.) Also, I honestly didn't have a whole lot of doubt about what I would decide, but it still felt very heavy and significant. (I sided with Edelgard.

"139",537,19,"Man",NA,5,"Yes","There's many instances I could site, but my favorite so far has been the whole story of The Secret World. For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me ""me"", and what doesn't. When I saw the parent buff and read ""they will be there for you in your time of need"", I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can't change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it.

"160",612,30,"Man",NA,5,"Yes","The game explores what it is to be a player and/or a creator. It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story. (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.)  It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer. It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue. Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative. Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.). In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way. (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)","The Beginner's Guide","I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.","1-2 years ago","No","Other","During the general gameplay, but also the way the game is framed and 'marketed'","N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,4,4,5,4,5,3,4,3,3,3,5,4,4,2,4,2,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,5,3,4,5,3,2,4,3,5,2,4,5,5,2,1,4,4,1,"Admiration, for the developer",0,0,94,24,"No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","Genre non-conforming games","Virtual Virtual Reality","Undertale","The Stanley Parable","Accounting","Jazzpunk","Yes","Yes","Yes","It focuses on an aspect of the human condition that I think specifically affects creative people, and double-especially closet introverts suffering from impostor syndrome.

I wonder though if one could feasibly draw a new definition of contemplation for games like Call of Duty or League of Legends for example (just using the most well-known titles of their respective genre umbrellas), where contemplation may arise as a process through mechanical and symbolic repetition (the kind of ""flow"" that early game studies people loved to talk about). Another extension of that that I think is kinda interesting to think about is how players confront virtual worlds which seem to offer a near-realistic level of representation of reality (ie the uncanny valley as an incomplete sublime; or the experience of a bug/glitch/edge of the map as an experience analogous to the surrealist interrogation of reality), or how players understand seemingly ""endless"" worlds of immense computational scale, as with games like Minecraft or No Man's Sky (something to be said here maybe about Kant's mathematical sublime).

"172",668,24,"Non-Binary",NA,5,"Yes","The most recent instance where I experienced a digital game as art it was a short (roughly 5-10 minutes) indie game about a person alone on a spaceship. The game's controls are very simple (there is one small choice at the end but otherwise the player can only move the player character around and occasionally interact with pieces of the set), but the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style, and the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player character's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed) person they miss; the player character walks this audience through daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee, tending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a hologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two interacted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are no longer sure of while the hologram degrades. While the letter speaks as though the addressee is alive and the two characters can see each other in the future, the narration has the emotional impact of an exploration of grief. After playing the game I immediately recommended it to some friends, telling them that the experience of playing it felt like the experience of reading a poem.","Under A Star Called Sun (by Cecile Richard)","The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.","<2 months ago","No","During the general gameplay",NA,"N/A",NA,NA,NA,"N/A",NA,1,2,5,4,4,1,5,3,5,1,2,2,5,5,1,2,5,5,5,4,1,5,4,5,3,4,1,5,5,1,1,4,5,1,4,5,4,1,1,2,3,2,NA,18,2,73,32,"No","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","No",NA,"Journey","Okami","Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask","Transistor","Shadow of the Colossus","No","No","Yes","I think it means that, while this game of course would not have affected all potential players in the same way, it tapped into something about a widely shared struggle with loss and impermanence.","Yes","I'm not sure how the emotional impact a game had on me could *not* affect how I viewed the game; the emotional impact is part of the game.","Yes","I played this game the other week, so I'm not sure what its long-term impact on me will end up being, but in the short term, I've found myself coming back to thinking about it several times.
